others . )\nBut now , being conspiracy-curious is the least of her concerns .\nGreene has a long history of cuckoo .\nIn addition to embracing QAnon , Greene has said that Muslim members of Congress should \u201c go back to the Middle East.\n\u201d She has also \u201c suggested that Muslims do not belong in government ; thinks black people \u2018 are held slaves to the Democratic Party \u2019 ; called George Soros , a Jewish Democratic megadonor , a Nazi ; and said she would feel \u2018 proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she were black because it symbolizes progress made since the Civil War.\n\u201d But this week , things got markedly worse when CNN \u2019 s KFile discovered that Greene had \u201c liked \u201d Facebook comments calling for US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D-CA ) to be assassinated .\nCommenters were discussing Pelosi being removed from the speakership , and one wrote : \u201c a bullet to the head would be quicker.\n\u201d Green \u201c liked \u201d that specific comment , which typically means you agree with it .\nShe also liked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c through removal or death , doesn \u2019 t matter , as long as she goes.\n\u201d Greene has also discussed \u201c hanging \u201d President Obama and Hillary Clinton , and she suggested separately , in a video on Facebook , that Pelosi should be executed for treason : \u201c She \u2019 s a traitor to our country , she \u2019 s guilty of treason , \u201d Greene says in the video , which she posted on Facebook at the time .\n\u201c She took an oath to protect American citizens and uphold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and comfort to

offline gave a Verizon error message .\nSo no vaccine for me !\nThis isn \u2019 t a new problem .\nDC \u2019 s Web site has been having problems for at least a month .\nA friend of mine went online almost exactly four weeks ago to reserve a vaccination for an elderly neighbor .\nShe was thwarted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captcha error doomed my effort to secure a vaccine today as well .\nCaptcha is used to stop bots from grabbing all the concert tickets , or in this case , vaccine slots , and reselling/redistributing them .\nBut how would that work exactly with Covid ?\nWhen you sign up for a vaccine , you have to give your real name and real address .\nNo bot can provide that .\nIf you show up to get the vaccine , and you \u2019 re not the person who registered , you don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why is DC using Captcha at all ?\nAlso , it simply doesn \u2019 t work .\nOn the DC site , every time I \u2019 d enter the correct Captcha , it would take a minute or two to send the information \u2014 the entire site immediately ground to a crawl the moment registration opened at 9am ET \u2014 and then it would tell me the Captcha information I entered was wrong .\nJust a guess , but by the time the site got to sending my Captcha information , Captcha had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NEW code to enter .\nBut it was too late to enter the new code , and the site was locked in the process of sending the old code that I had already typed .\nWhat resulted was this example below that I copied live .\nI entered the correct code \u2014 bV7gB5J \u2014 but as the page was \u201c processing \u201d my submission of

\u201d waited a long time , and here \u2019 s what popped up as I was waiting \u2014 an entirely new Captcha !\nI finally got a message saying I \u2019 d entered the wrong Captcha , when I obviously

could hit middle- and lower- income Americans hard", "content": "For a while now , Joe Biden has been advocating that we get rid of the \u201c stepped up basis on death \u201d that has long been a part of American tax law .\nSuch a move could hit middle- , and even lower- , income Americans hard .\nHere \u2019 s why .\nThe stepped up basis on death applies to property you inherit .\nThat could be stocks ( outside of retirement accounts ) .\nOr it could be your family home or apartment .\nWhat the stepped up basis does is protect you from having to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inherit .\n( Note , I \u2019 m talking about capital gains taxes , not inheritance taxes . )\nLet me give two examples .\nYou buy $ 5,000 of Apple stock in 2010 .\nThe stock value reaches $ 20,000 in 2021 , and you \u2019 ve therefore made a $ 15,000 profit , or capital gain , on your $ 5,000 investment .\nYou then have to figure out what federal and state capital gain taxes you owe on the $ 15,000 profit .\nSince this is a long-term capital gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one year , the federal capital gains tax is either 15 % or 20 % , depending on your overall income .\nThe state tax is very often your state income tax rate \u2014 in DC that \u2019 s anywhere from 4 % to nearly 9 % .\n( It also should be noted that if you make under $ 40,000 per year , your federal capital gains rate is zero , UP UNTIL the profit from the stock pushes your income over $ 40,000 , then you pay capital gains tax on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if this were me , a DC resident , I might owe as much as a 29 % tax on the inherited stock , or $ 4,350 .\nBut if you inherit the stock \u2014 say your mom gives it to you on her death , you won \u2019 t owe any capital gains at all , federal or state , so long as you sell the stock immediately .\nWhy ?\nBecause of the stepped up basis on death .\nWhat the law says is that when you inherit property , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the profit , as it were \u2014 is reset to zero .\nSo the IRS considers the $ 20,000 of inherited stock as if you just bought it , and you so far have no profit on it at all .\nSo you owe no federal or state capital gains tax unless and until the stock rises and there \u2019 s some new profit , or capital gain , on the stock .\nAny new profit , or gain , over the $ 20,000 basis , as it \u2019 s called , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get rid of this inheritance rule , and simply tax all inheritance property at the time of death of the person making the gift .\nThe same thing applies to homes .\nYour parents buy a home for $ 75,000 in 1970 .\nYour parents die in 2021 .\nThe home is now worth $ 600,000 , and you inherit it , per your parents \u2019 will .\nUnder existing law , even though the capital gain ( the profit ) on the home is $ 525,000* , you will pay no capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately , because the IRS consider the gain/profit wiped out at the time of your last parents \u2019 death , and reset to the current value of the home , $ 600,000 .\nUnder what Biden is proposing , your parents \u2019 home will be immediately hit with a 20 % capital gains tax , and state income tax , on their death .\n( And maybe even the ACA and Medicare taxes too . )\nIn DC , that means , again , 20 % plus nearly 9 % , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you otherwise were going to receive tax free \u2014 or $ 152,250 in taxes .\n( And again , there may be additional ACA and Medicare taxes as well . )\nThat \u2019 s zero in taxes under current law , versus over $ 150,000 under Biden \u2019 s proposal .\nThat \u2019 s a lot of money .\nEven middle- and lower- income Americans could be affected I \u2019 ve befriended a woman down the block from me in DC .\nShe \u2019 s 60 , living on disability because of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding the money to even pay for her prescriptions .\nI once mentioned to her that she could consider a reverse mortgage , as she surely has a lot of equity locked up in the house .\nShe said no way , this house has been in her family for generations , she could never give it up , even after death \u2014 she wants her family to inherit the family home and live there for generations .\nUnder Biden \u2019 s plan , it \u2019 s hard to see how that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her parents or grandparents paid $ 75,000 for the house ( and I suspect they paid even less , as DC wasn \u2019 t expensive at all back then ) .\nAccording to Zillow , her home is now worth $ 720,000 .\nThat \u2019 s a $ 645,000 profit , or capital gain .\nNormally , her heirs would pay no capital gains tax when they inherit the house .\nUnder Biden \u2019 s plan , they would be hit with a 29 % tax , costing them $ 187,050 .\n( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicated than this , but you get the idea \u2014 the tax isn \u2019 t insignificant . )\nThat \u2019 s a heck of a lot of money to a middle- or lower-income family .\nBut it \u2019 s worse than that .\nBiden has said he wants the tax owed on the death of the owner .\nThat means , her family \u2014 or her estate \u2014 will owe $ 187,050 the moment she dies .\nWhere are they going to get that kind of money ?\nThey \u2019 re going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The house that she so wanted to keep in her family , she refused to use it buy

them \u2014 may not even work at all ; \u2022 The vaccines might actually be really dangerous ; and \u2022 Biden is hiding the truth from the American people .\nYes \u2014 another day , another Fox News lie that could get a lot of people killed .\nBefore I dive into this , here \u2019 s Carlson spewing his latest deadly conspiracy theory , and here \u2019 s Dr. Fauci @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story about the Johnson & Johnson vaccine this morning , Axios reported the Biden administration is worried that halting distribution of the shot might encourage \u2018 vaccine hesitancy , \u2019 \u201d Carlson declared .\n\u201c In other words , don \u2019 t tell them it \u2019 s dangerous , they might not take it .\nThat doesn \u2019 t reassure anyone.\n\u201d Adding that this leads to the question of whether \u201c it is effective \u201d and \u201c does it work , \u201d the Fox News star asserted that public health officials are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is \u201d and are , in fact , \u201c they are telling you the opposite.\n\u201d \u201c Does that tell us that he believes the vaccine is ineffective ?\n\u201d Carlson rhetorically asked .\n\u201c He seems to think that .\nHere he is telling you that once you get the vaccine , you are still not allowed to eat or drink indoors at restaurants .\nYour life can \u2019 t really change at all.\n\u201d \u201c Experts say it is not entirely clear when it will be considered okay for people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masks , \u201d he stated .\n\u201c At some point , no one is asking this but everyone should be , what is this about ?\nIf vaccines work , why are vaccinated people still banned from living normal lives ?\nHonestly , what \u2019 s the answer to that , it doesn \u2019 t make any sense at all !\n\u201d Carlson continued : \u201c If the vaccine is effective , there \u2019 s no reason for people who \u2019 ve received a vaccine to wear masks or avoid physical contact .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they \u2019 re simply not telling you that .\nWell , you \u2019 d hate to think that especially if you \u2019 ve gotten two shots but what \u2019 s the other potential explanation ?\nWe can \u2019 t think of one.\n\u201d You can read Carlson \u2019 s entire monologue here .\nIt \u2019 s far worse than even the excerpt I quoted above .\nAmong other things , Carlson claims that Dr. Fauci and President Biden are covering up the true number of people \u201c hurt \u201d by the Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has declared that because the Johnson & Johnson vaccine has injured six people \u2014 which , if true , would make that vaccine much safer not just than birth control pills , but safer than many other vaccines we \u2019 ve distributed in the past \u2014 because this vaccine has hurt six people out of seven million , we need to stop using it immediately .\nDoes that make sense to you ?\nNo , it really doesn \u2019 t .\nIt seems possible there \u2019 s a lot more going on here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more dangerous than they \u2019 re indicating it is .\nFederal officials appeared to acknowledge that today .\nThey noted that it \u2019 s easy for physicians to miss the connection between the vaccine and the blood disorder it can cause .\nThat may be happening .\nFox News has been around since the 1990s , and they \u2019 ve always been liars in the pocket of the GOP .\nAnd this isn \u2019 t the first time we \u2019 ve been concerned about whether Fox \u2019 s lies would get someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they promoted before the 2018 election , that coincided with a domestic terror attempt in which the terrorist noted the caravan , comes to mind .\nBut last year , Fox really stepped up its lying game with the advent of the Covid pandemic .\nFox played a key role in helping spread the Coronavirus , after its hosts continually mocked and undercut masks , social distancing , the overall threat the virus posed , and then helped promote Trump \u2019 s absurd unproven Covid \u201c cures , \u201d like hydroxychloroquine .\nA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the rest of the right-wing media infrastructure , helped foment the January 6th Insurrection by amplifying and endorsing Trump \u2019 s election fraud lies .\nAnd now , we have Fox News basically telling people not to take the Covid vaccines , as experts fret that we may be on the verge of another large wave .\n( Carlson has been peddling vaccine hesitancy for months now . )\nWhat do you do

each platform seems to have different currencies it includes ( e.g.\n, some let you buy and sell Dogecoin , others don \u2019 t ) \u2014 there was also the larger question of security .\nCryptocurrencies don \u2019 t have the federal financial protections that stocks have .\nAnd in the past few years , there have been some famous raids on cryptocurrency trading platforms by people

your own cryptocurrency .\nYou can read a bit about the wallets here , and after you do , you may understand why I chose Robinhood instead .\nFor me at least , the entire subject was just too

break into ) .\nI liked that Robinhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the holdings \u2014 and that they also have insurance \u2014 but just as importantly , that Robinhood itself was responsible for handling the cold wallet .\nThe last thing I wanted was to keep my own cold wallet laying around my apartment to be lost , stolen , or burned in a fire .\nFor me at least , it \u2019 s easier to let Robinhood sweat the details .\nOverall , I find the Robinhood platform easy to use .\nIt was easy to sign up , easy to buy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep track of my investments using the app .\nRobinhood has gotten a bad rap for allegedly making the app too \u201c fun.\n\u201d That \u2019 s hogwash .\nThe app is easy and intuitive to use .\nI like that .\nNow , currently , Robinhood only permits you to buy and sell the following cryptocurrencies : Bitcoin , Ethereum , Bitcoin Cash , Bitcoin SV , Litecoin , Ethereum Classic , and Dogecoin .\nIt \u2019 s a relatively small list , but a pretty good one too .\nBitcoin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normally get the most press attention , and Dogecoin is more a gambling play , but it \u2019 s nice that Robinhood includes it , particularly with so much attention coming to Dogecoin of late .\n( I have holdings in all of the cryptocurrencies that Robinhood currently offers . )\nBecause of the nature of cryptocurrencies , trading happens 24/7 , and you can buy and sell crypto on Robinhood any hour of the day and night , every day of the week .\nAnd you can do market and limit orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnother nice aspect of Robinhood , in comparison to a number of other crypto trading platforms , is that Robinhood doesn \u2019 t charge you a transaction fee on crypto or stock transactions .\nThat can be particularly important if you lean more towards frequent trading , which I do not .\nOne negative of Robinhood is that they don \u2019 t let you pick and choose which lot you sell , and this has important tax implications .\nSay , for example , I \u2019 m really rich , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost $ 10,000 ; a second Bitcoin in January of this year for $ 30,000 ; and a third bitcoin last week for $ 60,000 .\n( Robinhood lets you buy fractional shares of crypto , so you don \u2019 t need to purchase a whole Bitcoin \u2014 I just wanted to make the math easy . )\nI then decide that I need some money , and want to sell one of my Bitcoins at the current price of $ 50,000 .\nDepending on which coin I sell , my capital gains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax hit as well .\nThe first coin has a $ 40k gain , the second a $ 20k gain ; and the third a $ 10k loss .\nSo , I \u2019 ll either owe taxes on the first two , or be able to take a partial write-off ( a capital loss ) on the third , depending on which coin I sell .\nUnfortunately , Robinhood , unlike other platforms , doesn \u2019 t give you a choice of which coin , or which stock , you sell .\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Out \u201d ( FIFO ) , meaning , the first stock they sell is the first stock you purchased , and then they work their way down the list chronologically .\nSo they \u2019 d sell the oldest Bitcoin investment first , the coin you purchased for $ 10,000 .\nThe3n if you sold another coin , they \u2019 d sell your second coin , the $ 30,000 one .\nIt \u2019 s strange that Robinhood has this limitation , as it \u2019 s a pretty basic aspect of financial trading and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific stock or coin lot they wish .\nHopefully , Robinhood will see the light and rectify this .\nRobinhood Won \u2019 t Let You Import and Export Crypto One final negative , which doesn \u2019 t bother me , but it does some of the more advanced crypto investors : You can \u2019 t import and export your cryptocurrency into and out of Robinhood , moving it to and from other cryptocurrency trading platforms .\n( As an aside , Robinhood does let you move stocks to other services , but does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other services . )\nAgain , this doesn \u2019 t bother me , but it is something others have complained about .\nIn the end , I personally felt comfortable with Robinhood \u2019 s security , and it was the easier option .\nI signed up for Binance.us , for example , and found the app just incredibly confusing to even buy and sell crypto \u2014 let alone their historical data \u2014 and I couldn \u2019 t make heads or tails of whether I needed to set up my own wallet .\n( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let you buy and sell a LOT of different crypto ) .\nI also checked out Paypal , which now lets you buy and sell Bitcoin , Ethereum , Litecoin , and Bitcoin Cash .\nIt \u2019 s interface is nice and super simple , but it doesn \u2019 t seem to let you buy and sell limit orders , which I found limiting .\nAnd of course , Binance.us and Paypal have fees for each transaction , while Robinhood does not .\nAs I was already using Robinhood for trading stocks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me .\nI worried that I might screw up the security if I handled it myself , and it \u2019 s been really easy to buy and sell crypto over these past several month .\nIf you want to give Robinhood Crypto a try , please consider using my referral link , and Robinhood will send you and me some cash as a thanks

\u201c socialists \u201d for as long back as I can remember \u2014 50 years ?\nOver that same period , Republicans have also claimed that we hate America , are bad for business , and won \u2019 t defend the country against foreign enemies .\nThey \u2019 re damning lies , and they cause electoral damage .\nOf course , with Trump , the shoe is finally on the other foot .\nNow it \u2019 s the Republicans who hate America and what it represents .\nAnd we need to remind people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which takes us back to Trump , who issued a statement this ( Monday ) morning , doubling down on his ongoing lie that he won the election : I fear Trump is going to get a lot of people killed .\nYou can not peddle a lie this big , this grave \u2014 you can not repeatedly tell people that there has been , for all intents and purposes , a coup d \u2019 \u00e9tat ; that the rightful president has been overthrown ; and that an usurper has stolen the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix the \u201c problem.\n\u201d Add to that the longtime Republican lies that Democrats are America-hating devils out to kill your babies \u2014 and now , with QAnon , we \u2019 re here to make sex slaves of your children \u2014 and the potential for something really bad to happen goes far beyond a lone crazy shooter .\nOne of our two main political parties , representing half the voters , has become a deadly

there are a handful of Republicans who have spoken out against Trump : Mitt Romney , Liz Cheney , Adam Kinzinger , David Frum , Rick Wilson , Steve Schmidt , and several more .\nBut in the aggregate , they hardly add up to the margin of error when calculating Republican adherence to Trump and his ideology of hate , lies and treason .\nLiz Cheney , by the way , took on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost her reelection .\nAnother vocal GOP critic of Trump , US Senator Mitt Romney ( who voted to remove Trump from office during the impeachment trial ) , was booed and called \u201c traitor \u201d ( by actual traitors ) this weekend at the GOP convention in Utah .\nThe only thing that might save us is Democrats , and anti-Trump Republicans , upping our messaging game .\nWe need to stop being afraid to call Republicans out in the strongest terms possible .\nWe need to call them a cult .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of liars .\nWe need to call them un-American .\nWe need to call them traitors and murderers .\nWe need

permanently", "content": "Facebook \u2019 s Oversight Board has reached its decision on whether to permanently ban Donald Trump from the platform .\nThey punted .\nHaving said that , I don \u2019 t think their decision is as bad as some say .\nHere \u2019 s why .\nOn January 7 , 2021 , Facebook banned Trump \u201c indefinitely \u201d after he used the social media platform to cheer on the deadly Insurrection against the US Capitol building the day before .\nFacebook has an Oversight Board that can review such decisions , and later in January , Facebook asked the board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe Oversight Board issued its ruling this morning , and it \u2019 s complicated , but also justly nuanced .\nOverall , the Board says that action against Trump was merited , but that the specific action Facebook took , to suspend Trump \u201c indefinitely \u201d \u2014 meaning , maybe for a short while , maybe forever \u2014 is too vague .\nFacebook either needs to ban Trump permanently , or suspend his account for a set and publicly-declared period of time ( and then , renew the suspension if they believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got him suspended in the first place ) .\nFacebook was likely hoping the Board would make a final decision for them , so that Mark Zuckerberg et .\nal.\n, could deflect any blame , from left or right , back to the Board members .\nAlas , that didn \u2019 t happen .\nThe Board ruled that the ban \u2014 suspension , really \u2014 stays in place for now , and Facebook has six months to review its decision , and either make it a temporary suspension that lifts or is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a permanent ban .\nThe Board also said that if Facebook does not reach a decision within six months , the ban will become permanent on its own ( kind of like a pocket veto in reverse ) .\nIn addition to its decision , Facebook \u2019 s Oversight Board posted a history of what happened on January 6th , and it \u2019 s clear the Board is none-too-thrilled with what Trump did .\nThis language should make it harder for Facebook to simply let Trump back on .\nElections are a crucial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2021 , during the counting of the 2020 electoral votes , a mob forcibly entered the Capitol Building in Washington , D.C .\nThis violence threatened the constitutional process .\nFive people died and many more were injured during the violence .\nDuring these events , then-President Donald Trump posted two pieces of content .\nAt 4:21 pm Eastern Standard Time , as the riot continued , Mr. Trump posted a video on Facebook and Instagram : I know your pain .\nI know you \u2019 re hurt .\nWe had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a landslide election , and everyone knows it , especially the other side , but you have to go home now .\nWe have to have peace .\nWe have to have law and order .\nWe have to respect our great people in law and order .\nWe don \u2019 t want anybody hurt .\nIt \u2019 s a very tough period of time .\nThere \u2019 s never been a time like this where such a thing happened , where they could take it away from all of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from our country .\nThis was a fraudulent election , but we can \u2019 t play into the hands of these people .\nWe have to have peace .\nSo go home .\nWe love you .\nYou \u2019 re very special .\nYou \u2019 ve seen what happens .\nYou see the way others are treated that are so bad and so evil .\nI know how you feel .\nBut go home and go home in peace .\nAt 5:41 pm Eastern Standard Time , Facebook removed this post for violating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Organizations .\nAt 6:07 pm Eastern Standard Time , as police were securing the Capitol , Mr. Trump posted a written statement on Facebook : At 6:15 pm Eastern Standard Time , Facebook removed this post for violating its Community Standard on Dangerous Individuals and Organizations .\nIt also blocked Mr. Trump from posting on Facebook or Instagram for 24 hours .\nOn January 7 , after further reviewing Mr. Trump \u2019 s posts , his recent communications off Facebook , and additional information about the severity of the violence at the Capitol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for at least the next two weeks until the peaceful transition of power is complete.\n\u201d The timeline reminds us that Trump posted his comments , egging the violent insurrectionists on , late in the day , after everyone was aware of how violent the day had become .\nFrom 4pm to 6pm ET , the Insurrection had already been going on for three to five hours .\nHere are some additional time markers , courtesy of Bill Moyers , so that you can fully appreciate just how bad Trump \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day \u2019 s events .\nThese were not comments Trump made during the fog of war , when no one even realized how bad the assault on the Capitol really was .\nThey \u2019 re things he said after everyone knew lives were at risk .\n12:30 pm : Josh Hawley gives soon-to-be rioters the thumbs up .\n1 pm : Trump supporters begin to storm the police barricades outside the US Capitol building .\n1:11 pm : Trump urges his supporters to march to the Capitol .\n1:26 pm : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Capitol .\n1:30 pm : Insurrectionists overrun the police barricades and make their way up the Capitol steps .\n1:49 pm : The Capitol Police Chief asks the National Guard for help .\nAt this point , not only is the Insurrection all over television , but the fact that the National Guard has been asked to intervene means surely someone thought to notify the President of this fact \u2014 after all , his own Vice President was there !\nTrump knew exactly how dire the situation was over two hours before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on .\n1:59 pm : Rioters have reached the Capitol doors , and are breaking windows in an attempt to enter .\n2:11 pm : Still more than two hours BEFORE Trump \u2019 s Facebook posts , the US Capitol building is breached by rioters .\n2:13 pm : VP Pence is rushed off the US Senate floor .\nTrump was absolutely informed of this fact .\n2:20pm : Members of Congress are trapped , pleading for help by phone to anyone in Washington who will listen .\nWe are still two hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on .\n2:24pm : Knowing his Vice President is under siege from a violent mob threatening to lynch him , Trump publicly criticizes Pence on Twitter : 4:17pm : An hour and 25 minutes later , Trump posts his Facebook video lauding and defending the rioters .\nIt \u2019 s bad enough what Trump did to aid and abet the violent insurrection on Facebook , but when you look at the timeline of events that day , Trump \u2019 s actions are far worse in context .\nAfter the entire country had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfolding violence , Trump weighed in , using Facebook to support the terrorist attack on our government .\nIt doesn \u2019 t get any worse than that .\nREAD MORE \u2014 > Read

for the next , should their growing legislative efforts in the states fails to steal future elections via a corrupt ballot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not only will we have to deal with a slew of Republican-passed state laws limiting voting rights , but Republicans are also shifting the responsibility for certifying the election from state secretaries of state to state legislatures .\nThey learned their lesson in Georgia in 2020 , when the local Republican secretary of state refused Lindsey Graham \u2019 s and Donald Trump \u2019 s entreaties for him to steal the election for Trump .\nIn the future , a Republican state legislature can simply overrule the will of the voters , and certify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GOP candidate clearly didn \u2019 t win .\nThere \u2019 s a second big problem .\nAs I \u2019 ve

QAnon kook Marjorie Taylor Greene , and the Republican party \u2019 s long history of using anti-Semitic tropes come election time .\nI assume you \u2019 ve heard the latest on what QAnon \u2019 s favorite congresswoman did this time around .\nTaylor Greene decided this would be a good week to rant about the Holocaust , and tie the murder of 6+ million Jews , gays , people with disabilities , Roma , political prisoners and more to masks .\nYes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mask is just like the ovens ( if the ovens were intended to save you rather than kill you ) .\nHere \u2019 s where it all started , with Taylor Greene doing an interview with Pat Robertson \u2019 s own David Brody .\nNote how Brody nods in agreement to every crazy thing Taylor Greene says .\nThen , we have Taylor Greene doubling down one day later : I \u2019 m going to wager that Jews feel a little more strongly about the Holocaust than simply \u201c not liking it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t like brussels sprouts .\nAlso , that last comment by Taylor Greene contains the implication that any Jew who supports mask mandates clearly isn \u2019 t rational , and thus had no problem with the Holocaust .\nA few days later , Taylor Greene does it again .\nIt \u2019 s clear that she knows what she \u2019 s doing .\nShe intentionally using the deaths of 6 million Jews to help enrage and build her crazy followers : And again , another comment that same day : Then , suddenly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said what she said : Never compared masks to the Holocaust ?\nReally ?\nLet \u2019 s go back to that first interview with Pat Robertson \u2019 s own David Brody : You know , we can look back at a time in our history where people were told to wear a gold star [ sic ] , and they were definitely treated like second class citizens , so much so that they were put into trains and taken to gas chambers in Nazi Germany .\nAnd this is exactly the type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ with masks ] .\nYes , she outright compared masks to the Holocaust .\nNice try , cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs .\nOf course , that same day she denied invoking the Holocaust , Taylor Greene couldn \u2019 t keep track of her lies , and retweeted a woman admitting that Taylor Greene made a \u201c Holocaust comparison \u201d !\nRepublicans forced to condemn Taylor Greene \u2019 s anti-Semitism , but it \u2019 s not enough After Republicans realized the growing uproar over Taylor Greene \u2019 s comments was hurting them politically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans , both of whom have a bad history with bigotry themselves , weigh in .\nFirst , GOP House leader Kevin McCarthy , who issued this statement five days after Taylor Greene went on her anti-Semitic spewing spree : And while it \u2019 s all well and good that suddenly Kevin McCarthy thinks anti-Semitism is wrong , he didn \u2019 t think so two years ago when he tweeted an incredibly anti-Semitic ad about rich Jews trying to buy the 2018 election .\n( Soros , Steyer and Bloomberg are all rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he has a Jewish name , so it works ) ) .\nNext up , # 2 House Republican , Steve Scalise , who couldn \u2019 t be bothered to issue his own statement , but rather had a staffer issue a lukewarm condemnation of Taylor Greene : Now , Scalise \u2019 s tepid criticism of Taylor Greene might carry more weight had Scalise not once called himself \u201c David Duke without the baggage.\n\u201d You

stunning report laying bare what we \u2019 ve long known to be true : The very wealthiest in our society have manipulated our tax code \u2013 and gotten away with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to end up paying very little or nothing in taxes .\nIn fact , the investigation found that the nation \u2019 s 25 richest Americans \u201c saw their worth rise a collective $ 401 billion from 2014 to 2018 , \u201d but \u201c paid a total of $ 13.6 billion in federal income taxes in those five years , \u201d a total that \u201c amounts to a true tax rate of only 3.4 % .\n\u201d This true tax rate of 3.4 % is much lower than the everyday working American pays in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ?\nSo billionaires can buy a second yacht or jet ?\nOr worse , so they can charter their own private rocket to space ?\nIf every member of the super-rich class paid what they are supposed to pay in taxes , the lives of everyday Americans would improve in immeasurable ways .\nThe social safety net would allow Americans the security to start small businesses , take bold career risks , and establish better lives for their children .\nAnd those billionaires ?\nAbsolutely nothing in their day-to-day lives would change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you \u2013 they \u2019 d still be impossibly rich .\nThe top 1 % should no longer be allowed to hoard wealth while the rest of America is struggling to get by .\nBut the only way bold

the Infrastructure bill , and it \u2019 s kind of an unnecessary mess .\nI just wrote about it in my newsletter , CyberDisobedience , but in a nutshell , Biden is supporting language that doesn \u2019 t make any sense , and hurts the environment .\nIt favors energy-inefficient crypto like Bitcoin , while harming energy-efficient coins like Ether ( Ethereum ) .\nIt \u2019 s a long and complicated

pretty good job of explaining the problem in a way that \u2019 s easy to understand .\nHere \u2019 s a snippet : Biden \u2019 s position will worsen the environmental impact of crypto by de-incentivizing more energy-efficient currencies .\nYou may recall that in the last few months there \u2019 s been a lot of concern over Bitcoin being super energy-intensive .\nWell , the \u201c compromise \u201d bill language ( drafted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) that the White House is pushing will punish currencies like Ether ( Ethereum ) that are potentially 11,000 times more energy efficient than Bitcoin , while giving Bitcoin a pass !\nAnother concern of people who know crypto much better than I , like Mark Cuban , is that the White House language will stymie innovation on the cryptocurrency blockchain .\nVery complicated , but think of it like the early Internet .\nWhatever your position on it , and where it \u2019 s heading , you don \u2019 t want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Senate , I know that when money comes into play , the substance goes out the window .\nThe fact that fixing the crypto language in the Infrastructure bill could cause CBO to claim that the bill brings in less tax revenue \u2014 when CBO is already saying the bill won \u2019 t pay for itself \u2014 is enough to get the White House to simply throw good sense out the window , and keep even bad language if it
