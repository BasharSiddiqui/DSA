dead in the span of just a few years .\nThen imagine that it wasn \u2019 t because of a pandemic or any accidental means .\nIt was intentional , systematic , well-planned , and precisely executed

were intentionally , systematically exterminated .\n\u201c Extermination \u201d is an appropriate word , because it fits how Adolph Hitler and his minions viewed the Jews .\nThey portrayed them as rats \u2013 vermin .\nThrough movies and posters , Jews were shown to be greedy , avaricious , dirty , and only out for themselves .\nThey were characterized as less than human , cartoonish with huge noses and greedy leers , disgustingly scurrying about with their half hominid/half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you do when you have a rat problem ?\nYou exterminate them , thus the genesis of the \u201c Final

.\nAnd for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devastating .\nWhere was God ?\nThat is the question you will hear from so many of the Holocaust generation and the succeeding generation .\nIf there truly is a God , why would He allow this ?\nSadly , there are a great number whose conclusion was that a good God would not have allowed the Holocaust , therefore there must not be a God .\nI know that it was horrific pain that led them to this conclusion .\nHowever , I believe there is a better answer that can leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes from knowing that no matter what we see around us , there is a good God who loves us and watches over us .\nThe answer to the Holocaust is found in the necessity for God to allow evil .\nGod didn \u2019 t create evil .\nHe never had a desire for evil to exist .\nHowever , He had to allow for the possibility of evil .\nThat \u2019 s because God is love .\nThe apostle John wrote , \u201c He who does not love does not know God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 John 4:8 ) We have been created in the image of God , and one aspect of that imago dei is our ability to love .\nHowever , in order for us to truly love , we must have free will .\nForced love is not real love .\nIt is programmed love \u2013 robot love .\nIf we are truly going to love God , we must have the ability to choose whether or not we want to love God .\nWhat does it look like for us to love God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote , \u201c For this is the love of God , that we keep His commandments .\nAnd His commandments are not burdensome.\n\u201d ( 1 John 5:3 ) In other words , how do we know that we love God ?\nBy choosing to live righteously .\nFor us to be able to \u201c choose \u201d to live righteously , we also have to have the freedom to \u201c choose \u201d to live unrighteously .\nSadly , unrighteousness was the choice that Adam and Eve made in the Garden , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us has made since then \u2013 \u201c \u2026for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.\n\u201d ( Romans 3:23 ) For there to be true love , there has to be the possibility of true evil .\nIf God were to eradicate all evil , free will would go away taking real love with it .\nIf God were to eradicate all evildoers , I would not be around to write this article and you would not be around to read it .\n\u201c Okay , Amir , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God brings about the new heaven and the new earth .\nBut that doesn \u2019 t mean that God has to allow all evil .\nThe Holocaust was so very evil , why didn \u2019 t He step in then ?\n\u201d That , admittedly , is the more difficult question .\nI can easily explain the existence of evil .\nBut it pains me to have to try to explain God \u2019 s allowance of this particular evil .\nTo attempt an explanation , I have to go back to what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFirst , God limits evil .\nWe see this in the story of Job , when the Lord first limits Satan to attacking Job \u2019 s possessions and family \u2013 \u201c Behold , all that he has is in your power ; only do not lay a hand on his person.\n\u201d ( Job 1:12 ) Then He allows the devil to go after Job \u2019 s body , but not his life \u2013 \u201c Behold , he is in your hand , but spare his life.\n\u201d ( Job 2:6 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a \u201c this far and no farther \u201d line .\nWhen it comes to the Holocaust , our line may have been very different than God \u2019 s line .\nWe may have put it before even one life was lost .\nBut this is when we have to trust in what we know about God .\nAs we read earlier , God is love .\nHe is the epitome of love .\nWe may not understand His limits , but we have to trust in what we know about His character and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am alive right now shows the \u201c this far and no farther \u201d nature of our God .\nWhy did He allow my grandparents to survive while so many others perished ?\nI don \u2019 t know , but I am very thankful that He did .\nSecond , God allows evil to exist , but not to win .\nHitler did not win \u2013 he died in a bunker when , like a coward , he took his own life .\nGoebbels did not win .\nHimmler did not win .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ all dead and gone , and their memory is one of infamy and disgust .\nThis is the final end of all evil and evil-doers .\nEven Satan himself understands that he doesn \u2019 t stand a chance in this good versus evil battle .\nHe has seen God .\nHe knows he \u2019 s a goner .\nThis is why He fights so hard to hurt God in the time that he has left .\nWhat is the best way for Satan to bring pain to God ?\nBy hurting those whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel and the church .\nSatan used a morally twisted Austrian corporal to lead Germany to war , thereby opening the door for his demonic attack on the Jews .\nGod allowed this genocide for a time until He said , \u201c No more.\n\u201d After eradicating the evil and the evildoers , God did what He always does in the midst of pain and sorrow , He brought beauty to the ashes .\nWhat the devil intended for the wiping out of the Jews , God used to bring His people back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Israel .\nIn the fulfillment of Ezekiel 37 , God took the dry bones of the survivors of Auschwitz and Buchenwald and Dachau and all the others , put muscle and flesh back on them , breathed new life into them , and returned them to their ancestral home .\nThis would not have happened without the Holocaust .\nIn the words of Joseph to his kidnapping brothers , \u201c But as for you , you meant evil against me ; but God meant it for good , in order to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to save many people alive.\n\u201d ( Genesis 50:20 ) On this International Holocaust Remembrance Day , let me encourage you to use it as a time of prayer .\nFirst of all , pray for those who still bear the scars of the suffering and the loss , particularly those of the generation of my parents and my grandparents .\nIt has affected them profoundly , and still many struggle today .\nSecond , pray for the peace of Jerusalem .\nDespite the Abraham Accords and the growing relationships with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aligned against it .\nPray that God keeps the rockets and missiles on the other side of our borders .\nFinally , take time to praise God for His love .\nWe can love because He first loved us .\nAnd even though there are times when we may not understand exactly what He is doing , we can still know His character and be assured that His love is as profound as always and that He is working out His perfect plan for those who love Him and follow Him .", "author": "Behold Israel", "url": "https://beholdisrael.org/where-was-god-during-the-holocaust/",

unleavened ) life , Jesus .\nThe Seder meal consists of 14 traditions , with various forms of observance by Jewish communities worldwide .\nThe meal ends with the traditional blessing that has been repeated since the Jews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Jerusalem \u201d , a prayer that finally came to pass with the establishment of the Jewish homeland , Israel .\nTwo thousand years ago , on Passover Eve ,

.\nAs observing Jews observe this day of mourning , they will traditionally fast ( water and food ) , emphasize the use of certain ointments , and mourn in various ways .\nThey will also refrain from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hobbies , and bathing , among other things .\nAlso commemorated on this date is the Bar Kochba Revolt in 133 A.D. , when the Jews fell to the Romans , followed by the plowing of the

@ @ @ @ @ @ land for 70 years ( Jeremiah 29:10 , Daniel 9:2 ) .\nAs previously mentioned , the second temple was destroyed when the Romans sieged Jerusalem , ultimately leading to the diaspora of the

mouse game .\nTwice he had been provided the opportunity to kill King Saul and twice he had spared the man \u2019 s life .\nWho was he to raise his hand against the Lord \u2019 s anointed ?\nBut rather than recognizing that David was not a threat and backing down , King Saul continued to pursue him .\nFinally , the fugitive had enough .\nRecognizing that there would never be peace for him in Israel , David took his men and escaped to Philistine territory .\nHe made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king of Gath ( a city from which had come a certain giant that David had previously dealings with ) , and David and his men and their families settled in the capital .\nSoon , though , it became apparent that this wasn \u2019 t the city for them .\nMaybe the people weren \u2019 t thrilled at having some of the hated Jews living with them , or maybe Goliath had some over-sized family members who still held a grudge .\nWhatever the reasons , David went to Achish and essentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town isn \u2019 t big enough for the both of us .\nHow about my men and I move to an outlying town where we won \u2019 t be underfoot all the time ?\n\u201d Achish agreed and gave Ziklag to David .\nThe future king settled his company there , and it was from Ziklag that David conducted his secret raiding parties .\nWhen biblical minimalists attack the Scriptures , they often begin with historicity .\nIf they can prove an inaccurate history , they can prove an inaccurate Bible .\nOne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because , along with Abraham and Moses , David stands in the triumvirate of great heroes of the Old Testament .\nTheir talking points fall short though , because typically they are arguments of silence .\nIn other words , there is nothing that has been found in archaeology that they can show contradicts the existence of David .\nInstead , they can only argue that there has not been enough evidence found that can definitively prove the existence of the great king .\nIt is true that there have been no front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Dave \u2019 s Place \u201d or cave etchings that read , \u201c David , son of Jesse , slept here \u201d .\nHowever , the extra-biblical evidence for the great king is growing .\nThere are the Tel Dan Stele that refers to the \u201c House of David \u201d and the Moabite Stone that contains that same phrase .\nThe discovery of what appears to be the remains of King David \u2019 s palace outside Jerusalem \u2019 s northern city wall adds even more credence.i Then in 2019 , in the area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Philistine region of Gath , a site called Khirbet a-Ra \u2019 i has been unearthed that many believe to be David \u2019 s old settlement of Ziklag.ii There are a couple reasons to believe that this perfectly located dig is revealing the future king \u2019 s old town .\nFirst , there are the artifacts found and their dating .\nAbove several strata filled with Philistine artifacts is one that can be dated to the time of David .\nOn that particular level , rather than Philistine material , archaeologists have found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were discovered twenty miles southwest of Jerusalem at Khirbet Qeiyafa , an ancient Israelite fortress overlooking the Elah Valley.iii A Philistine village filled with Israelite artifacts says that something unusual took place at that specific moment in history .\nA second reason for believing this is David \u2019 s Ziklag is that there is evidence of an intense fire that burned many of the town \u2019 s buildings.iv According to 1 Samuel 29-30 , when the Philistines were going up to fight against King Saul , David and his men were turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhen they returned to Ziklag , they found that in their absence the Amalekites had raided their settlement , kidnapped all the women and children , and burned the town to the ground .\nOnce again , archaeology perfectly matches the biblical account .\nThese facts were evidence enough for lead archaeologists Yoseph Garfinkel , Saar Ganor , Kyle Keimer , and Gil Davis to conclude that Khirbet a-Ra \u2019 i is in fact David \u2019 s Ziklag.v Archaeologists have never nor will ever uncover historical evidence that contradicts the Bible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from cover to cover .\nOnce again , our faith in the accuracy of Scripture has been justified , this time by a small village that was once occupied by a certain man who was a fugitive and future king

Hashana is \u201c The head of the year \u201d \u2013 namely , the beginning of the Jewish New Year .\nHowever , biblically , the feast that we are told to be celebrating has absolutely nothing to do with the beginning of the year as it was the first day of the seventh month : \u201c \u2026Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying , \u201c Speak to the children of Israel , saying : \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first day of the month , you shall have a Sabbath-rest , a memorial of blowing of trumpets , a holy convocation .\nYou shall do no customary work on it , and you shall offer an offering made by fire to the Lord\u2026 \u2019 \u201d ( Leviticus 23:23-25 ) There are many traditions as for why the Feast of Trumpets is now the head of the year , but none of them is biblical whatsoever .\nHowever , the trumpets element of this unique feast is extremely important .\nThe Bible tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two silver trumpets .\nThese trumpets were formed in order to direct the camp in its journey from Mt .\nSinai towards the Promised Land , as well as the calling for the attention of the people .\nAnd the Lord spoke to Moses , saying : \u201c Make two silver trumpets for yourself ; you shall make them of hammered work ; you shall use them for calling the congregation and for directing the movement of the camps .\nWhen they blow both of them , all the congregation shall gather before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of meeting .\nBut if they blow only one , then the leaders , the heads of the divisions of Israel , shall gather to you .\n5When you sound the advance , the camps that lie on the east side shall then begin their journey .\nWhen you sound the advance the second time , then the camps that lie on the south side shall begin their journey ; they shall sound the call for them to begin their journeys .\nAnd when the assembly is to be gathered together , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance .\nThe sons of Aaron , the priests , shall blow the trumpets ; and these shall be to you as an ordinance forever throughout your generations.\n\u201d ( Numbers 10:1-8 ) Since 1948 , for the first time in modern history , the nation of Israel and the Church exist at the same time .\nI believe that God is using both of them as the two silver trumpets , calling for the attention of the world and preparing those that are willing to repent to get ready for their journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of the Lord !\nAre you a trumpet ?\nAre you living like one ?\nDo people see in you the need for them to change ?\n\u201c \u2026.For if the trumpet makes an uncertain sound , who will prepare for battle ?\n\u2026 \u201d ( 1 Corinthians 14:8 ) We need to be ready for our imminent journey to our Promised Land .\nIt is very brief but immensely longed for .\nIt \u2019 s the Rapture .\nIndeed , the trumpets are sounding !\nDo you hear them ?\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : We shall not all sleep , but we shall all be changed\u2014in a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , at the last trumpet .\nFor the trumpet will sound ,

the Hebrew calendar will unlock the mystery of this feast .\nThe blast of the horns on Rosh HaShana is a signal for preparation .\nWhat is it that the people should prepare for ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which takes place ten days later .\nThat trumpet blast was the signal for the Israelites to enter into a time of repentance and introspection , known as the 10 Days of Awe , so that they would be prepared when the time came for that holiest of all days on the Jewish calendar .\nIn the same way businesses often have both a calendar year and a fiscal year , the Jews were given both a calendar year and a spiritual year .\nThe spiritual year began with the Feast of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis led to ten days of getting one \u2019 s heart ready which culminated in the Day of Atonement , a somber and sorrowful time during which the sins of the people were covered over through the work of the High Priest .\nBut the calendar doesn \u2019 t end there .\nFive days later , Sukkot or The Feast of Tabernacles begins , a week-long celebration of God \u2019 s grace and provision .\nIn these three special days \u2013 Trumpets , Atonement , and Tabernacles \u2013 we find a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWe begin by preparing ourselves to enter into His presence .\nWe reflect on His majesty and our humility .\nIt is then that we are ready to truly repent of our sins , trusting not in the offerings of a high priest but the personal sacrifice of the Great High Priest , Jesus Christ , when he died on the cross to provide for our forgiveness .\nThen comes the time of celebration when we remember God \u2019 s grace and mercy that He \u2019 s given to us and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result .\nSo , take time today and celebrate Rosh HaShana by preparing yourself for a fresh start with God .\nLet today be

of His death on the cross , and a commitment to turn from those sins , removing them from your life never to go back .\nAfflicting one \u2019 s soul recognizes that it is not about me any longer or my

"source": "beholdisrael", "title": "The True Meaning of Sukkot (The Feast of Tabernacles)", "content": "Amir \u2019 s commentary on The Feast of Tabernacles .\nJews around the world will begin to commemorate Sukkot ( The Feast of Tabernacles ) on Monday evening .\nWhat is the purpose of this eight-day observance , and does it biblically portray a greater story than the feast itself ?\nImmanuel \u2013 \u201c God with us \u201d .\nThat is a name that we typically think of around Christmas .\nMatthew reminded us of this glorious title when , while speaking of the birth of Jesus , he alluded to the words of God through Isaiah the prophet : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that God is near .\nAgain , it is the theme when we as Christians celebrate Jesus coming into this world as the perfect God/man .\nIt is also the theme of the Jews \u2019 celebration of Sukkot , or the Feast of Tabernacles .\nSukkot is an eight-day feast which Jews all over the world will commemorate by building booths , or sukkahs , decorating them with plants and fruits , and maybe even sleeping in them .\nFrom the outside looking in , it is a very strange practice .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it comes right from the mouth of God through His servant Moses : Leviticus 23:33-36,40-43 Then the Lord spoke to Moses , saying , \u201c Speak to the children of Israel , saying : \u2018 The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the Feast of Tabernacles for seven days to the Lord .\nOn the first day there shall be a holy convocation .\nYou shall do no customary work on it .\nFor seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to the Lord .\nOn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a holy convocation , and you shall offer an offering made by fire to the Lord .\nIt is a sacred assembly , and you shall do no customary work on it\u2026 .\nAnd you shall take for yourselves on the first day the fruit of beautiful trees , branches of palm trees , the boughs of leafy trees , and willows of the brook ; and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God for seven days .\nYou shall keep it as a feast to the Lord for seven days in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statute forever in your generations .\nYou shall celebrate it in the seventh month .\nYou shall dwell in booths for seven days .\nAll who are native Israelites shall dwell in booths , that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt : I am the Lord your God.\n\u2019 \u201d It is that last verse that helps it all make sense .\nThis is about the Exodus .\nGod wants the Israelites to remember that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Egypt .\nBut what about this astounding event is He reminding them of ?\nIs it just , as the passage says , that they dwelt in booths ?\n\u201c Hey , guys , remember that time I had you live in temporary shelters for 40 years ?\nYeah , kinda crazy , huh ?\n\u201d No , to get the meaning , we must dig a little deeper .\nLiving in temp housing for eight days was an experiential reminder that for a time the Israelites didn \u2019 t have their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were homeless , hapless , and helpless .\nWhat they did have was God .\nHe was their one constant , and He was completely sufficient .\nThat is Immanuel \u2013 \u201c God with us \u201d .\nThe Feast of Tabernacles or Booths is not ultimately about tabernacles or booths .\nThey are simply the methodology that God had chosen to remind the Jews that He has always been and always will be with them .\nBut that is a principle that is not just for the Jews .\nGod is always with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is why this seventh and final Feast is the only one that continues long into the future .\nZechariah 14:16-19 And it shall come to pass that everyone who is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall go up from year to year to worship the King , the Lord of hosts , and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles .\nAnd it shall be that whichever of the families of the earth do not come up to Jerusalem to worship the King , the Lord of hosts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIf the family of Egypt will not come up and enter in , they shall have no rain ; they shall receive the plague with which the Lord strikes the nations who do not come up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles .\nThis shall be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all the nations that do not come up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles .\nTwo facts to notice about this passage .\nFirst , Zechariah is prophesying regarding the Millennium .\nSo , this is a future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept during the thousand year reign of Christ .\nSecond , the ones celebrating will be from \u201c all the nations \u201d \u2013 Jews and Gentiles alike .\nSo all people from all over the globe will come to Jerusalem .\nWhy Jerusalem ?\nBecause that is where Jesus the Messiah , the King of Kings and Lord of Lords , will sit on the throne of David and rule His global kingdom .\nAgain , that is God with us , not just in smoke and fire , but in His resurrected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because there will be a time when the Feast of Tabernacles is fulfilled and there will be no more need for it .\nIn the new heaven and new earth , there will be no more need for our tabernacles .\nGod Himself will tabernacle with us for eternity .\nAre you ready for that day ?\nAgain , the tabernacles the Jews built represented their complete dependence upon God for all things .\nHave you come to a place where you are completely trusting in God for every part of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , let me encourage you to build that tabernacle in your heart today .\nRecognize your need for Him .\nGive yourself to Him by receiving Jesus as your Lord and Savior .\nOpen the door in your life for God to be with you always .", "author": "Behold Israel", "url":

, also known as the Festival of Lights , is a holiday based on the story and tradition of the Jewish people \u2019 s defeat of the Seleucid Empire ( Syrian-Greeks ) in the Holy Land .\nIn the 2nd century BC ( 165 ) , a small army of Jews called the Maccabees staged a rebellion against the Seleucids during their attempts to Hellenize the Jewish people and the land of Israel .\nUnder the reign of Antiochus Epiphanes IV , the targeting of the Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priesthood to implement his agenda by appointing his own high priest .\nHe even used the funds from the Temple treasury to support his military pursuit concerning Egypt .\nAnd in his more severe attempts of Jewish persecution , he stole items like the menorah from the Temple and even placed an idol of Zeus inside .\nHe believed that he himself was Zeus-manifest .\nBut perhaps his most notorious act was when he desecrated the Temple by slaughtering a pig on the altar .\nThe Maccabean Revolt commenced in 167 BC following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish religious practice , which led to a Jewish priest named Mattathias killing a Hellenized Jew who made sacrifices to idols .\nHe also killed the Greek official who enforced the sacrifice ( s ) .\nHe would die just one year later after fleeing to the mountains with his five sons , and it was his son , Judah Maccabee , who staged the rebellion mentioned above .\nAfter their eventual victory , the Maccabees would make their way into Jerusalem , rededicate the Temple , and install the youngest brother as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s nickname was \u201c Maccabeus , \u201d which is derived from the Hebrew word for \u201c hammer \u201d ( \u05de\u05b7\u05e7\u05b8\u05bc\u05d1\u05b8\u05d4 ) .\nThe book of Daniel undoubtedly makes several mentions of Antiochus IV without mentioning him by name , and it \u2019 s commonly believed that both Antiochus and the Maccabees were in view when the angel Gabriel clued Daniel in on the future : Daniel 11:31-32 And forces shall be mustered by him , and they shall defile the sanctuary fortress ; then they shall take away the daily sacrifices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThose who do wickedly against the covenant he shall corrupt with flattery ; but the people who know their God shall be strong , and carry out great exploits .\nA Jewish tradition at the time was to light Chanukiah ( Hanukkah Menorah ) in the Holy Temple in Jerusalem daily .\nAs tradition tells , when the Maccabees liberated the Holy Temple in Jerusalem , a miracle occurred as only one day \u2019 s worth of oil for lighting the menorah lasted for eight days .\nHence the tradition of eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the holiday , one additional candle is lit commemorating and remembering the strength of the Jewish people and God \u2019 s deliverance from their enemies .\nHanukkah means \u201c dedication \u201d and refers to the rededication and liberation of the Promised People \u2019 s Holy Temple and center of worship to God .\nModern festivities include eating of latkes , potatoes , pancakes , and donuts , as they are cooked in oil .\nYoung children typically light the candles and sing traditional songs , playing with the \u201c dreidel \u201d , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acronym of \u201c a great miracle happened there.\n\u201d While the holiday is a minor holiday in Jewish tradition , in Israel , the holiday is a time of unity and ceremonies held throughout the nation .\nJohn 10 : 22-23 records , \u201c Then came the Feast of Dedication at Jerusalem .\nIt was winter , and Jesus was in the Temple area walking in Solomon \u2019 s Colonnade.\n\u201d As a Jew , Jesus most certainly would have participated in the Feast of Dedication .\nThe same courageous spirit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense persecution was passed on to Jesus \u2019 disciples who would all face severe trials because of their faithfulness to Christ .\nAnd like the miracle of God \u2019 s presence expressed through the eternal flame of God burning for the Maccabees , Jesus became the incarnate , physical expression of God \u2019 s presence , the Light of the World who came to dwell among us and give us the eternal light of God \u2019 s life .\nMay we all remember the two most important things from this holiday : Matthew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the light of the world .\nA city that is set on a hill can not be hidden .\nNor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket , but on a lampstand , and it gives light to all who are in the house .\nLet your light so shine before men , that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven .\n\u201d", "author": "Behold Israel",
