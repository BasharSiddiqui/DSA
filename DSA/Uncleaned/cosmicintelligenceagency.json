\u2013 https : //twitter.com/Sassephoto The Fractal Nature of Astrology with the Venus Star .\nAs seekers of astrological wisdom we are often confronted by the bigger questions of \u201c why does astrology work ?\n\u201d .\nWe know it works , we see it working in our lives , in our clients lives and in the world around us in so many varied and profoundly interesting ways .\nYet it is hard to define exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not one single explanation will ever suffice .\nSomething that has helped enlighten my journey of astrological understanding , of why the patterns and cycles of the planets continue to coincide with our lives , is the understanding of astrology as a dynamic fractal like system .\nThat once set off at birth , as a birth chart or as any radix chart a dynamic is carried forward , with its own unique formula and conditions , which then continues to unfurl and unfold as a never ending fractal like pattern of growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales .\nThey are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop .\nDriven by recursion , fractals are images of dynamic systems \u2013 the pictures of Chaos .\nGeometrically , they exist in between our familiar dimensions .\nFractal patterns are extremely familiar , since nature is full of fractals .\nFor instance : trees , rivers , coastlines , mountains , clouds , seashells , hurricanes , etc .\nAbstract fractals \u2013 such as the Mandelbrot Set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculating a simple equation over and over .\n( 1 ) When viewing a fractal pattern , one can see that any part of the pattern can be recognisable within any scale of the pattern , from the micro to macro .\nAs an infinitely complex , recurring and repeating , dynamic system , astrology suits also these dynamics , of being \u201c fractal like \u201d in nature .\nIn both fractal dynamics and astrology , patterns are found within patterns , patterns and cycles are always reflected as part of a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dynamics set off in a birth/radix chart continue to live and are activated , through the constant movements of the cosmos astrologers call planetary transits , these transits and cycles continue to inform the initial conditions set at birth .\nAs we engage with astrology we see familiar patterns constantly unfolding , yet always in a slightly different context , we see them unfold in a spiral dynamic and not a linear one , in an aspect of being the same or similar too , but never quite the same .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious attention to the dynamics operating in any astrological chart , we are engaging in a feedback loop , we are constantly putting in , receiving and releasing more information , that then continues to fuel the unfolding pattern .\nSeen through an astrological lens we can see how the constant re-engagement with our astrology charts is the feedback loop which renews our astrological fractal pattern and sets off constantly revised and updated versions of the inherent pattern held within .\nIf we envision our astrology charts as alive and constantly vibrating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any or every point , we can see that as we change , adjust , transform , grow , mature our fractal mandala does the same .\nIf you could just imagine , your astrology chart as a living fractal , set from the initial conditions , the formula which is your birth chart , the time stamp , date , place are set into motion , consider your unique astrological mandala that will have its own formula and cosmic cycles attached to it .\nLike the music of the spheres , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight to see , yet one we can just imagine working with for now .\nWhat would yours look like ?\nWhen would be the times that a new pattern emerges ?\nWe can see it being sparked and ignited by transits , progressions , eclipses or whatever other methods we may choose to use .\nIt becomes ever more alive and dynamic as we become more conscious of it and how it is working and what we put back into the feedback loop .\nEvery-time you make a conscious or unconscious connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astrology chart , another spike of your fractal ignites .\nTo see our astrology charts as one continual living fractal , is to see the pattern of creation that was set for us before our physical birth , and one that we continue to unfold and evolve way into the future .\nAt once we can see that the pattern abides to a deterministic view , being we can \u2019 t change our initial formula or given pattern , yet with a fractal like view of the chart , we can see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working , as the shifts and changes in our lives set off new patterns or growth and understanding .\nTHE VENUS CYCLE All planets create patterns around the earth in their cycles , yet none are as elegant , perfect and beautiful as the one created by the synodic cycle of Venus through our zodiac .\nVenus , not only the brightest planet in our evening and morning skies , attributed universally to the principles of beauty , aesthetics , love , peace and harmony , not surprisingly she also has a most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the geometry of her five pointed cycle .\nThe perfect geometry of the Venus cycle is made with her star points , the times when she joins the Sun at a conjunction in the zodiac .\nThe Venus cycle around the earth , the zodiac and our astrology charts is made up of 8 year , 4 year , 19 month and 9.5 month cycles which demonstrate a cosmic geometry like no other , which we can use as an example to reflect growth patterns that unfold in our lifetimes and in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The perfect geometry of the Venus cycle is made with her star points , the times when she joins the Sun in a conjunction in the zodiac , in either her inner or outer conjunctions .\nThe Venus cycle around the earth is made up of 8 year , 4 year , 19 month and 9.5 month cycles which demonstrate a cosmic geometry like no other , which we can use to reflect growth patterns that unfold in our lifetimes and in our charts .\n( See Image 2 ) The timing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every 9.5 months Venus and the Sun join in our heavens and zodiac , alternating from interior conjunctions ( when retrograde ) to exterior conjunctions ( when Venus is behind the Sun ) every 9.5 months .\nThese are what we call Star Points , the Venus and Sun conjunctions , the Cazimi Points or Venus Star Points , ( VSP coined by Arielle Guttman in her pivotal book Venus Star Rising ) ( 2 ) Every 19 months , 1.6 years = 584 days , Venus completes one whole synodic cycle from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Synodic meaning meeting place , in this case the meeting place of Sun/Earth/Venus .\nEvery 4 years \u2013 48 months Venus will return to the same star point but in the opposite position every 4 years .\nFor example in 2017 Venus made a retrograde star point at 4\u00b0 Aries , she will make the same star point in March 2021 at 4\u00b0 Aries again , 4 years later , but from the opposite side of the Sun , the exterior conjunction .\n( 3 ) Every 8 years , 96 months Venus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zodiac over 8 years , having made 5 exterior and 5 interior conjunctions ( when retrograde ) with the Sun .\nThese Venus Star points are only ever made in 5 places in the zodiac at any particular time .\nThe Venus points move slowly backwards in the zodiac , and oscillate at these degrees for approx 16 years at a time , taking about 40 years to move backward approx 10\u00b0 in the zodiac .\nAt the moment in this decade at the end of the 2010 \u2019 s , the Venus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19\u00b0 , Scorpio 3\u00b0 , Leo 21\u00b0 , Gemini 13\u00b0 and Aries 4\u00b0 .\nAstrologers generally tend to see the retrograde times of Venus as the most significant aspects of Venus , in regard to transits and timing .\nYet once tuned into the Venus Star pattern , we see the that the whole star becomes relevant and every point of the star be it retrograde or direct as significant , especially when we look back at the history of our Venus Star .\nLike the movements of the Moon , a Venus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the opposite side of the Sun .\nThe moon does this yet around the earth , for a new moon at a certain degree in the zodiac , will occur as a full moon 4 years later in the opposite sign of the zodiac , with the Sun in the same position and zodiac degree ( give or take a day or degree or 2 ) .\nWe can look at star points as focus points that occur in the zodiac every 9.5 months occurring 288\u00b0 forward in the zodiac each time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next retrograde comes to pass , or every 4 years as a reflection point of the last retrograde as we get a review of a particular transit from the other side or perspective .\nIn many ways with Venus and her Star Point cycle we get a sense that Venus is connecting many more dots than we may give her credit as a great creative conductress .\nShe is the planet of attraction after all , and ruled by the metal of copper embodying the qualities of conducting heat and electricity and gathering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star , 5 pointed star and pentacle is created in our zodiac , and of course therefor our astrology charts .\nNow we need to look at the Venus Cycle as a complete star pattern which remember moves slow backwards in our astrology charts .\nWhen we look at the whole star , we begin to see patterns formed with each point , being conscious not to isolate one Venus point , yet see all points as part of the a complete pentacle pattern forever forming in our charts .\nAs we plot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an idea of which parts of our chart Venus touches , what zone or houses will be most activated , what planets will be highlighted and what angles maybe crossed in a life time and so on .\nTo track and find the Venus Points in any astrology chart we need to find the 5 Venus points ( Venus/Sun conjunctions ) that occurred in the 4 years around your birth , before or after , to set the sequence in place .\nThen with the diagram ( image 2 ) , add the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and you can clearly see a zone in your astrology chart where the Venus Star has been orchestrating a particular rhythm for you !\nThe Sacred Geometry , Golden Mean , Divine Ratio , Fibonacci of the Venus Cycle The 5 pointed star and pattern created by the Venus cycle is often also referred to as a Venus Rose , as the pattern is closely linked to the unfolding ratios found in Sacred Geometry , the Golden Mean as well as the Fibonacci sequence .\nThe ratio 1.6 , attributed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the divine proportion , the beauty of patterns of growth unfolding in nature and can be found throughout the Venus cycle and the geometry of a Pentacle .\nThis \u201c golden \u201d number , 1.618 is represented by the Greek letter Phi , and is also known as the Golden Ratio , Golden Number , Golden Proportion , Golden Mean , Golden Section , Divine Proportion .\nSacred geometry is a science that explains physical energy patterns of growth and harmony , found everywhere in the natural world .\nWe see this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiral galaxies , hurricanes , in an unfolding rose or alluvial plains .\nThese divine ratio principles have been used since ancient times in art , design , architecture to create harmonious , balanced and aesthetically pleasing pieces .\nThe Fibonacci sequence , a mathematical formula follows this same pattern of growth where the numbers 1,1,2,3,5,8,13 etc , also embody the phi ratio , where each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two and divide as the 1.6 ratio .\nThe golden spiral and the fibonacci come together in Diagram/Image 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the smaller part , is to the larger part , what the larger part is to the whole .\n( See Image 4 ) We are reminded with these exquisite connections with Venus and her cycle as being very much a part of and embedded with this creative and divine force .\nThe Pentacle , has many expressions of 1.618 hidden within its simple geometry as well , for when you draw a smaller Pentacle inside the larger Pentacle , it reduces at the rate of 1.618 , and so on forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geometry , as shown through Da Vinci , and his Vitruvian Man \u2019 s divine proportions .\nWith this in mind , as we begin to track the movements of the Venus star and her geometry throughout our astrological landscape it is hard not to connect and be more conscious of what is unfolding at each point of contact , our patterns of growth and consequent turning points with the Venus Points .\nThe more conscious we are of these patterns unfolding within the context of the grander pattern or life story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-creative aspect of our being and the intelligence we can glean by working with this cosmically attuned cycle .\nTo use the Venus Star in astrological work is too much to go into in this article , Yet begin with plotting the Venus star in your chart as mentioned above .\nSee the zones in your chart ignited with the Venus Star , remember they don \u2019 t change quickly and move slowly backwards in the zodiac over time .\nSee where the Venus Star has made contact with planets and crossed angles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when these points will come again .\nAs Venus signifies bonds of love , creative pursuits , pleasure , happiness and engaging in life \u2019 s enjoyment we can see significant times in life present themselves to do with marriage , children , divorce , love and loss , as well as career highlights , promotions and creative and passionate endeavours taking hold .\nI tend to look at the Venus Points , similarly to coming eclipse points , and see them as focal points that fuse together the complexity of transits in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming Venus point begins to take effect months before its exactness and continues to reverberate months after exact culmination .\nThey seem to activate , as do eclipses certain houses as a focus for that time frame .\nIt can help us to make sense of the gathering of energies over a certain time frame of life in 9.5mth increments !\nThe current star point cycle we are now is the cycle that began with Venus retrograde in Scorpio , it culminated with a Venus point in Leo , in August 2019 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it begins a new cycle with Venus retrograde in Gemini in June 2020 .\nThe last time Venus was retrograde in Gemini was in June 2012 for the transit of Venus ( 4 ) , yet the last time she made a star point here was June 2016 at the outer conjunction 4 years ago .\nConnect to points and find that they will all be relevant , some of course more than others , but nevertheless they will all be related .\nTo use the Venus Star is to get back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your client with what is at the heart of what is going on in life , and a chart , what is coming and what is going and knowing that overtime when another point is made , a new experience is had , or an old one arises again , we are setting off the next fractal pattern of growth and adjustment .\nThere are many ways to connect to the Venus Star , to be ignited by the glorious Venus Star and her workings , to be ever more connected to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet earth .\nLook , watch , sense , observe where she has been so far and where she will be going next .\nAlign with this profound , sacred and natural pattern of growth !\nTo work in this way is a living example of working with the ever moving fractal mandala which we call astrology .\n3 \u2013 When Venus is conjunct the Sun , obviously we can not see her in our skies , and this is often attributed to her being in the \u201c Underworld \u201d stemming from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Inanna \u201d .\nVenus when retrograde , is only not visible for about 8-12 days , whereas when she visits the other side of the Sun , disappearing behind the Sun , she is out of sight for over 80 days , and therefore longer in the underworld .\nShamanic astrology sees this part of her cycle as the \u201c Descent of Inanna \u201d as she is ushered into the \u201c Underworld \u201d over 7 months by the waning moon conjunctions through 7 gates , and then ascends from the underworld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conjunctions over 7 months .\nIt is important to remember this when using the Venus star to know that the superior conjunctions can often be the most significant in one \u2019 s life , yet often overlooked , deeming the retrograde more significant .\nYour own observations and tracking Venus cycles will show that the outer conjunctions also significant turning points as are the inner conjunctions , retrogrades .\n4 \u2013 Read more on the Venus Transits of 2004-2012- The cycle of Venus

rather terrifying roads of mathematical equations and hypothesis .\nI do this in order to peer into works of physicists , mathematicians and quantum theorists , and to observe what they have been up to over the last few years and decades .\nAs I am only somewhat inclined towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a task .\nWhat I am really about is a \u2018 pattern-ology \u2019 ; I have a knack for identifying nuanced patterns in number , nature and in behaviors , which is to some degree , a skill most astrologers must develop .\nMathematics could be described as a study in patterns .\nOne might also describe astrology this way .\nI believe that many of the missing links that are required to scientifically understand astrological influences have already been discovered , but are not yet fully appreciated in the larger framework @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no distinction between science and spirituality ; we only choose to make it so .\nThe ancient world viewed all spiritual studies as scientific , and all science as spiritual and sacred .\nMany breakthroughs , which have yet to be realized or assimilated by those of us in the metaphysical disciplines , have been made within the empirical sciences .\nWe , as astrologers , are just as guilty of excluding the relevance of the newly discovered mainstream scientific facts and tools from astrology as science has been to exclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe majority of both camps have chosen to remain separate in their own self-identified , self-focused worlds\u2026 and that has to change .\nAnd since we are the world-bridging wisdom holders , it is up to us to make the effort to change things .\nSome within the mundane scientific disciplines have begun to recognize what the ancient sages have always known , that ultimately everything is connected \u2013 we are literally one with all .\nWhat are you ?\n!\nThe Greek phrase gn\u014dthi seauton or temet nosce in Latin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times .\nMany astrologers use the ancient Delphic maxim ; \u2018 know thyself \u2019 as a way to emphasize horoscopic astrology as a personal practice .\nI would add , that the phrase is a directive for you to seek the awareness of what you truly are\u2014and that it is intentionally left open-ended .\nAlmost everyone begins their astrological studies through knowing their Sun sign and then their personal natal chart .\nThis gives us a much better understanding of what we consider as our self , and how that self relates to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the first step in taking that self knowledge outward beyond the human level of awareness .\nTo truly know One Self , one must go beyond a self .\nBut if we do share a common connection to everything and everything manifests from and returns to source , then what is self anyway ?\nWhere does \u2018 thyself \u2019 actually end ?\nOr does it ?\nAnd how does one begin to comprehend Self beyond self ?\nTo find out what celestial components we are made of in this particular life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say our self , within the \u2018 here and now \u2019 by plotting our position and path in space-time .\nThe personal natal chart is the tool by which one begins to truly know oneself .\nThis tool is made of symbols which describe natural forces and energies that coalesced at the time of your birth , and of which you are still essentially comprised , yet are always being affected by the processes of time .\nWe have observed and described these energies through their qualities , cycles and patterns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we use to interpret our internal makeup , our biology and our behaviours .\nYet , the energies which we are describing extend beyond self , beyond the planet , into the solar system through the galaxy and ultimately to the edge and center of the Universe itself\u2014simultaneously .\nThe resonant energy fields expressed by the planets and the Zodiac are our ingredients .\nThese cosmic energy frequencies are imprinted deeply throughout our genes and arranged within our very elements .\nWe emit our personal zodiacal radiation signature as we interact and react @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us .\nWe are bio-transceivers of frequencies , antennae for communicating spiritual energy .\nThese energy fields are a part of us , just as we are part of them .\n~ As without , so within .\nHow do we know ?\nAll of our senses recognize patterns .\nWe visually perceive our surroundings by recognizing color , depth , texture , etc .\nFor example , color is a spectral frequency , a pattern of light .\nDirect observation means seeing visual patterns , which are pervasive in nature .\nVisual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaotic , never quite exactly repeating , and involve fractalization on some level .\nPatterns with a beginning and an end must have deviation .\nNatural patterns stem from a centre axle creating spiralling wave forms of geometric points of intersection ; the places in space-time where those symmetries of rotation and reflection interact .\nAll patterns have a regular underlying mathematical structure ; indeed , mathematics as a whole can be described as the search for regularities .\nThe derivative of any function is a mathematical pattern .\nThat equation is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicate how each half of a reflective variable equates .\nThe recognition of the central balancing point between two entities of different domains is the fundamental purpose of math\u2014finding the center .\nThink in terms of energy , frequency and vibration .\n~Tesla .\nOur senses tend to cross over with their patterns , and in turn , how we perceive them .\nThis is called synesthesia or \u2019 union of the senses \u2019 .\nIn humans , tastes correspond to smells , and in some animals , scents become visualized .\nUltra- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , or touch , which directly

opposing qualities , so that the antithetical aspect of one would always be found directly opposite the other .\nTo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within , each of the primary opposites mirrors the other as the exponentially duplicating schema expands and contracts .\nEither by multiplying or dividing , the two forces composes polarizing waves of energy creating a pulse or phase .\nOne phase of this pattern organizes complementary harmonizing angles .\nAnother dimensional phase manifests an opposing mirrored form to complement the first harmony .\nYet , where there is a harmony , a dissonance must also emanate synchronously , so various interactive qualities result in order to compensate and to balance the equation .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ synthesizing ( conjuncting ) ; the principle of \u2018 two \u2019 is

emerged since the advent of computers is the Mandelbrot Set , a set of infinite self-similar continuous patterns of coordinates , exhibiting an increasingly elaborate boundary of recursive fractalization .\nThis mathematical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newly recognized natural law , which declares that nature is self-similar across all scales .\nIf nature resonates an archetypal construct on one level , it will reuse that construct on another level .\nThis constructed order radiates from a central core .\nThis nexus originates as a set of axes in space , aligning to an up/down or north/south configuration , and in turn creates forward/ back and left/right .\nIt is comprised of energy moving within a defined geometric sphere .\nYou can see this in how particles orbit within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planets as they travel within the heliosphere of a star , and how solar heliospheres orbit \u2018 galacto-spheres \u2014 galaxies .\nSo the atoms too must be in an intricate corresponding

@ @ @ @ into Aquarius , at the same time at the US Pluto return and with Saturn also in the sign of the water-bearer , this surge of Aquarian energy is set to transform the social order .\nOur

, principled and progressive .\nA marriage of the air element with the fixed quality , Aquarius is determined , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scientific innovation is high on the Aquarian agenda .\nOriginality and logic go hand-in-hand to spawn new inventions .\nAquarius always has an eye on the future .\nWith Pluto here there \u2019 s a tendency towards decentralisation as groups and communities reassert and reclaim power , joining forces and linking up in networks to share resources .\nThis is likely to include sharing electricity that is generated and stored across neighbourhoods .\nWind power is just one of many fields that will gain traction in this new economy , helped along by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new green infrastructure .\nPluto in Aquarius seeks to level the playing field so that power is shared more equitably .\nPersonal ownership will be largely superseded by group sharing and co-operatives are likely to flourish .\nIt \u2019 s not just astrologers like me who are forecasting these changes .\nIn his book , The Third Industrial Revolution , best-selling author Jeremy Rifkin discusses how lateral power , technology and renewable energy will soon transform life on earth .\nRifkin outlines the many opportunities and challenges that lie ahead .\nDistribution is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water-bearer .\nAquarius pours forth all manner of life sustaining concepts and materials .\nAquarius is an air sign , but water plays a key role in its symbolism .\nWater purifies and cleanses .\nThe Sun moves through Aquarius mostly in February , which comes from the Latin , \u2018 februare \u2019 meaning \u2018 to purify \u2019 .\nThe water-bearer showers us with a feeling of refreshment .\nThis is a fresh beginning .\nA new day is dawning .\nIn myth , Aquarius is linked to the beautiful youth Ganymede @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him his immortal cup-bearer .\nGanymede provided ambrosia to the gods to sustain their immortality .\nAquarius renews and brings life .\nGanymede was also Zeus \u2019 lover , so Pluto in Aquarius may also help to uphold the rights of the LBGTIQ community as well as those who are otherwise marginalised .\nNew clashes with old when Pluto moves through Aquarius , as advanced concepts emerge based on fresh discoveries .\nIn 1781 when Pluto was last in Aquarius , the wildcard planet Uranus was discovered , forever altering the cosmology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uranus has been accepted by many astrologers as the true ruling planet of Aquarius .\nApart from its unexpected discovery and its unusual rotation , the symbolic meaning of Uranus also stems from the fact that it was discovered during this epic time in history , a time of radical social turmoil as the First Industrial Revolution , the French Revolution and the American Revolutions forever transformed society .\nIt \u2019 s easy to see how Uranus has gained acceptance as the ruling planet of Aquarius over the traditional ruler Saturn .\nNew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aquarian motif as new concepts and inventions propel us towards the future .\nAn earlier , but equally radical overhaul of the map of the solar system happened 238 years before Uranus was discovered , when Pluto was also in Aquarius .\nIn 1543 Copernicus first set down his findings that the Sun and not the Earth was the centre of the solar system .\nCopernicus passed away in 1543 , but shortly before his death .\n[ 5 ] he published his ideas concerning the heliocentric nature of the solar system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres ) .\nHis book completely revolutionised the thinking of the day .\nOf course there were many nay-sayers , just as today there are those who deny the reality of climate change .\nAquarius is the sign most associated with technology and science , and Pluto has deep roots that stretch back through past generations .\nWith Pluto located in the sign that Uranus rules , one might expect that there will be people who will find it hard to accept these changes , given that both planets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibilities and new discoveries always confront old ways of doing things , but this is especially so when Pluto is in Aquarius .\nBecause something has always been done a certain way , does not necessarily make it correct .\nToday , with the future of life on our planet at stake , the need for an awakening is urgent .\nWith Pluto in Aquarius it seems that we are set for a mighty intense encounter that is set to shake things up .\nThis will be the mission of youth .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neptune in Aquarius ( 1996-2011 ) , come of age we are starting to witness a wide ranging philosophical shift towards a more compassionate and humanitarian paradigm .\nBetween 1532 and 1554 Pluto in Aquarius continued to undermine the power of the Roman Catholic Church , as the Protestant Reformation spread across Europe .\nThe Reformation began with Pluto in Capricorn as it made a conjunction with Saturn in January 1518 .\nThis was when Martin Luther \u2019 s 1517 theses of complaint against the church was translated and distributed throughout Europe .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ press and increased literacy .\nPeople who were previously afraid to speak out against the power and corruption of the church created their own system of worship and belief led by the likes of Martin Luther , John Calvin and John Knox .\nWith Pluto in Aquarius the ultimate consequences of these revolutionary forces were dramatic and far reaching .\nThe imminent transit of Pluto through Aquarius is again likely to bring about systemic reform to corrupt institutions .\nThis time around Pluto in Aquarius is once again following a conjunction of Pluto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stellar arrangement that we have not witnessed in that sign since 1518 .\nAt the start of Pluto \u2019 s journey through Aquarius in 1532 , Henry VIII defied the authority of Rome .\nHe divorced his first wife , Katherine of Aragon and married Anne Boleyn , establishing himself as the head of the Church of England .\nHe then set about dissolving the Monasteries in England , Wales and Ireland ( 1536-41 ) , appropriating their assets and income .\nIt was at this time ( 1543 ) that Copernicus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planets orbited the Sun , further undermining the authority of Rome .\nIn January 1547 , Henry VIII died .\nHe was succeeded by his only son , Edward VI , who accelerated the agenda of religious reform initiated by his father , despite being only a young boy king .\nIn 1549 , the first English Prayer book was introduced .\nAlthough it might not seem like a big deal by today \u2019 s standards , at the time this was a radical change .\nEdward died in 1553 and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence installed Lady Jane Grey as Queen not wanting the country to return to Catholicism under Mary I .\nThis rebellion was thwarted and nine days later Mary I was installed as Queen , setting the scene for further turmoil as she set about returning England to Catholicism with equal zeal as Pluto began to move into Pisces .\nAt the same time in South America the Spanish , led by Pizarro , were insisting that the Inca convert to Christianity .\nIn 1533 the Inca Empire stretched across vast reaches of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold and silver and brutally massacred and enslaved their people , while European diseases like smallpox and measles systematically destroyed their empire .\nThe moment that Pluto shifts into humanitarian Aquarius signals the commencement of this new era and the chart for this momentous event holds clues as to its likely manifestation .\nThe first thing to note is that this ingress happens hot on the heels of the 2023 March Equinox .\nThere \u2019 s a stellar line up of planets in enterprising Aries , including Chiron and freedom-loving Jupiter .\nMars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 29GE03 making a tight square to the Sun and also a quincunx to Pluto , suggesting this will not be an easy process .\nThe need for cleansing and healing of the environment is clearly indicated by Pluto \u2019 s conjunction with asteroid Hygeia , goddess of health and hygiene while both are squared by the Nodal Axis .\nNote also that Saturn has just concluded its transit of Aquarius , passing the Aquarian baton to Pluto .\nThe challenge will be to implement a humanitarian agenda and progressive policies and , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have the courage of our convictions as we move into uncharted territory .\nUranus in Taurus is propelling us towards a green economy with business rather than politicians leading the way .\nCryptocurrencies are also radically shifting the economic structure .\nPluto in Aquarius will augment these revolutionary trends .\nAs with all revolutions , we will probably initially struggle to make the necessary alterations .\nAs we make the shift towards a sustainable lifestyle , it \u2019 s worth mentioning that after Pluto has been in Aquarius for a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five trine aspects ( 2026-2028 ) with Uranus in Gemini .\nThis is likely to be a highly creative , inventive and productive time , when new technology will transform society in ways we can barely imagine .\nThe last time that Pluto was in Aquarius ( 1778-99 ) there was huge growth in the number of corporations , as groups of people ( Aquarius ) began to buy shares ( Pluto ) .\nBetween 1781 and 1790 the number of corporations in the US grew from just 33 to 328 [ 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spawned growing opposition to slavery .\nToday , there are many people who suffer appalling working conditions , not to mention those who are unable to find work , or who are homeless , or otherwise disadvantaged .\nPluto in Aquarius will overhaul the workforce as artificial intelligence makes for more redundancies and new digital technologies are rolled out .\nFor many years the rich have been getting richer , which has exposed the lie of the trickle down economy .\nPluto in Aquarius is set to shake the foundations of our social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the green economy seeds the growth of sustainable practices .\nDon \u2019 t be surprised if Pluto in Aquarius creates a groundswell of protest against poverty and inequality .\nSome will say that the new Aquarian advances have caused the problem , but in the long run Pluto in Aquarius will bring about a more fair and equitable system while also creating a swathe of new employment opportunities .\nPluto ( Scorpio ) and Aquarius ( Uranus ) are both fixed entities , not given to flexibility or compromise .\nBut both are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to occur .\nEqually , these archetypes are associated with two vastly different elements that do not mix easily , water ( Pluto ) and air ( Aquarius ) .\nThey have different agendas and perceptions .\nAquarius is scientific and rational , an air sign , while Pluto is connected to the depth of the water element , which feels things internally and deeply and seeks to maintain control and power .\nWhenever water and air come together there is an agitating , stirring , aerating bubbling up of forces .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an understanding of water , given its role to distribute this life giving element .\nThe shift from Pluto in cardinal earth sign Capricorn , to fixed air sign Aquarius , takes us from a political agenda to a principled one .\nAquarius values concepts and ideas , knowledge and innovation .\nWhile Capricorn is pragmatic , Aquarius won \u2019 t stand for hypocrisy and does not hesitate to speak out against corruption and prejudice .\nWith Pluto moving through Aquarius ( 2023-44 ) the hope is that a new generation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence and lead the way towards a fresh healthy future of new and exciting possibilities .\nDistribution is a key function of the sign of the water-bearer .\nAquarius pours forth all manner of life sustaining concepts and materials .\nAquarius is an air sign , but water plays a key role in its symbolism .\nWater purifies and cleanses .\n[ 1 ] This time period includes an approximately three month period during which Saturn retrogrades back into Capricorn , before returning to Aquarius .\n[ 2 ] Venus-Mars cycles are born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few weeks apart .\nWhile the first conjunction is a

appears obvious that only a radical shift in both individual and collective consciousness might save us .\nAs long as our minds are ruled by personal interest and ignorance , political or economic measures will not prove to be effective .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to extract meaning from it we question what can astrology offer in order to heal the world and help to create a better one ?\nDoes it possess the means to radically impact our philosophical outlook and thus modify our way of life ?\nThis is not a rhetorical question , but applies to the here and now as we are currently determining

.\nVarious forms of astrology were discovered by many different cultures , as early as prehistory , because the heavenly splendor caught our attention .\nAbove us , so far out of reach , everything looked majestic , untouched by death and certainly closer to the notion of the sacred .\nWe felt awed by its sparkling order , so alien from our chaotic lives and confused thinking .\nNot only did it look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marvel at , but we discovered that its mathematical perfection was somehow related to us as Plato exclaimed in the Timaeus : \u2018 God invented and gave us the sight , so that in contemplating the revolutions of intelligence in heaven , we might apply them to the revolutions of our own thought , which , although disordered , are related to the imperturbable revolutions of heaven.\n\u2019 To unveil the intimate relationship that our psyches and our destinies sustain with celestial geometry was a significant step ; nature seemed to have left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its hidden mechanisms .\nOf course , in the Greek philosopher \u2019 s world , the bond between nature and humanity was not yet severed ; we were part of nature and naturally looking to it for guidance .\nMoreover , the universe , life , and consciousness had to signify something , and astrology was a key to their comprehension .\nThe Uranian age and the golden age of astrology The idea that astrology can reposition the quest for meaning at the very heart of our consciences does not imply a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past .\nOn the contrary , our new revolutionary and fast-changing world , that is , the Uranian world , suits astrology perfectly .\nUranus was discovered in 1781 when the American and French revolutions , and most notably the outbreak of the industrial era , altered the face of the world .\nLinked to revolution , creative thinking , psychology , as well as to all new technologies , Uranus quickly proved to be the key planet for astrologers , given its remarkable omnipresence in their birth charts .\nIn keeping with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown off the image of an old lady wrapped in her mantle of traditions and thousand-year-old superstitions .\nThis has disintegrated to the point where we can consider that her golden age is perceived to be more in the future than in the past .\nOne of the purely technical influences on this is the significant role that Uranian ruled computers have played in advancing many of our studies and research practices .\nCalled \u2018 mathematicians \u2019 in Greece , the astrologers of ancient times had to be scientists and astronomers as constructing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThey would certainly have given anything to gain access to our fabulous Software , with its ability in a few clicks to compute and display with incredible precision planetary positions over thousands of years !\nNowadays , with disconcerting ease , we attempt to establish the maps of the heaven of the Buddha , Lao Tzu , or Pythagoras , all born around the great conjunction of Uranus , Neptune , and Pluto in 578-575 B.C.\n, which seems very much related to the \u2018 Axial Age \u2019 [ 1 ] .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ celestial configurations that presided over crucial historical events , perhaps to thereby infer what tomorrow will be like .\nAnyone , be they a politician , movie star , historical figure , neighbor or family member is a potential subject of study , once their natal coordinates are known .\nThis computational facility finally allows everyone to know his or her astral chart , which was rarely the case before , a fact that will prove essential when we examine the concept of identity that astrology offers .\nIn addition to technology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of astrology is that knowledge is spreading like never before : schools , associations and international organizations are blooming , treaties number in the hundreds and excellent translations of ancient texts , considered as rare treasures until recently , have become easily accessible .\nEven more importantly , astrology feeds on the revolution of ideas germinating everywhere .\nIts Uranian nature marries perfectly with the often referenced new paradigm , which puts consciousness at the center of our grids of interpretation of the universe and life .\nScience , philosophy and psychology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defined as intrusions of meaning into our relationships and destinies : some of the answers provided by astrology are quite astounding [ 2 ] .\nQuantum physics leads to the perception of space , time , matter , and energy as vast networks of vibrations and information in which all the different elements are in contact and where the observer is no longer separated from the thing observed .\nIt means that the physical distance between the stars and us is not a barrier to our psychic link with them anymore , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypotheses about vibratory , magnetic or gravitational influences that were never formally discovered .\nIn a world where scientists think that 85 percent of the mass of the universe is composed of a mysterious and undetectable dark matter , and whose cosmogonic conceptions are sometimes strangely close to Brahmanism [ 3 ] , the hypothesis of a human consciousness analogously structured by an inner solar system is perfectly viable .\nAlso feasible is the idea that if the whole psyche is probably not physically influenced by the stars , it is possibly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the manifestation of a celestial geometry that structures it , orients it and impregnates it with meaning and finality .\nSuch intellectual , philosophical , and spiritual effervescence , drawn from the most recent scientific trends , offers astrology its chance .\nWe are in dire need of new thinking patterns able to shake our consciousness to its roots : ideas can start like a raging wildfire and engulf the world with a snap of a finger .\nWhatever the truth about its still largely unexplained mechanisms , both the way astrology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzling relationship with the universe appear unique .\nWhy is it so ?\nThe foundation of astrology remains concrete and observable , even though it deals with the meaning of existence , psyche , and destiny .\nAstrology is based on a tangible and remarkable link that is essentially composed of meaning , and which connects us to the universe .\nThis link that builds a bridge between the visible and the invisible is the subject of its study .\nIts approach to the mysteries of life does not rely on myths , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rests on a real , perceptive and insightful observation of celestial geometry .\nThrough observing the location of the planets as they orbit the Sun , their motion , speed , rise and fall , their encounters with the Moon , their mutual interactions and so many other facts , we finally discovered that this celestial ballet concerns us .\nEven more profoundly we could decipher and understand it and it could be read like a book written about us .\nOne might assert that this is just another belief system , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through observation .\nThis is how astrologers are made .\nThey don \u2019 t start to practice astrology because they believe in it , but rather because they try it and in most cases are amazed that it works !\nWhat we could call celestial geometrical synchronicities are there for everyone to perceive , and astrologers can provide examples of these by the thousands .\nThe tangibility of this link enables astrology to be particularly qualified to impact the collective consciousness .\nScience has profoundly changed us , and like Thomas the Apostle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flesh .\nThis is exactly what astrology proposes .\nConstituted through meaningful synchronicities happening between the celestial mechanics and our lives , the link can be touched , felt and explored .\nBy its very existence this link conveys the essential idea that this universe , which has become terrifyingly vast , acknowledges our presence , thereby offering us an identity .\nThis concept goes hand in hand with recognition : through the birth chart the universe provides us with an identity more fundamental than our gender , blood , name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of faith .\nPerhaps it gives us back a part of what we ostensibly lost when Copernicus drove the Earth out of the center of the solar system or when Darwin told us that we were just like any other animals .\nWhile it was obviously important for us to comprehend these truths , values that were thousands of years old were destroyed in the process .\nAs a species we felt , and in many cases still feel , lost , insignificant , disconnected , and devoid of meaning .\nThese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn response , astrology offers a cosmic identity that recognises each of us as an individual\u2014 \u201c what is indivisible \u201d .\nAn individual is an organized unity , someone unique and in one piece .\nTo realize this provokes a Uranian behavior which involves taking oneself out of the undifferentiated flock of followers , of whatever is being followed .\nThe Uranian age asks us to face life and death as individuals , while standing and thinking alone ( wholly one ) .\nParadoxically , this loneliness , which is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than we have ever been .\nOne individual does not stand above or below the others , but at their side , as a perfect equal .\nThis certainly leads us to understand the harmfulness of comparison , itself a cause of aggressive competition .\nBuilding one \u2019 s destiny around a unique astral chart makes one incomparable , in the etymological sense of the term .\nSimilarly , this acknowledgment rejuvenates our relationship with the environment , healing the wound which arises from the sensation of being separated from nature , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in turns addresses one of the reasons why we destroy nature , as we only destroy what we do not like , or what has become indifferent to us , Things feel entirely different when one realizes that in some mysterious ways , which again are not belief-based , the universe gives us its attention .\nMicroorganisms we might be , but we are also endowed with a significant life .\nThe solar hero and the quest Yet this recognition , this identity , has a price : our birth chart implies a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word destination , the concept of destiny evokes both a function and a place to which one goes .\nAnd so , here we are back to the need for the meaning of life , in the absence of which it all turns out badly .\nIt is probably here , as we talk about a function and a quest to be pursued , that astrology shows the greatest capacity to influence the consciousness .\nThe quest orders the mind by providing a concrete expression to the meaning of life .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a direction disappears .\nIn this particular framework , anyone famous or anonymous , educated or illiterate , needy or wealthy becomes a solar hero fighting darkness and fear in the pursuit of the truth of his or her nature ; an action that is not born from fear or a desire for reward .\nTo be a solar hero is to follow the inner sun that shines in the sanctuary of one \u2019 s own heart .\nBoth philosophically and spiritually , the quest is the movement of universal intelligence .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have already observed .\nIt is born from the recognition of the universe and the identity it offers us , from the necessity to have meaning in one \u2019 s life .\nIt visibly emanates from our birth chart , without which the latter can not fully thrive .\nA destiny that is not touched by the quest misses its purpose , while its unfolding generates a know-thyself based spirituality .\nOne becomes a light unto oneself by exploring wisely one \u2019 s own nature .\nAnd as one gets rid of fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advancing more and more freely on the path outlined by the chart \u2019 s geometry , one does fulfil one \u2019 s destiny , eventually finding the inner place that awaits us .\nThe path to the flowering of destiny We now understand that the quest , which leads to truth , realization , or whatever you call it , is the most vital element of the flowering of destiny .\nAlthough the goal is the same , the journey follows a different path in each chart because of its uniqueness .\nUnless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one needs to consult an astrologer , whose main function is to reveal the geography of the inner territory in order to decipher the celestial scripture .\nThe crowning aim of the interpretation is to expose the path that crosses the chart and leads to its heart .\nBut even the best astrologer in the world won \u2019 t take you there .\nThe journey through the ninth house ( long travels , spirituality ) , or through the twelfth ( exploration of the inner depths ) , must be undertaken alone .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth chart , and everything it represents , illuminates the journey .\nThis chart helps to overcome fears and obstacles by making sure one treads the right path .\nOne can get lost , wander , hesitate , lose confidence , but the personal star we follow always comes back shining in front of us until we get back on our way .\nTo travel alone does not mean in isolation .\nIt does not hinder exchanges of information , thoughts and ideas , as long as we do not become second-hand people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chart does not marry well with organized faiths or ideologies : astrology strives for individual freedom of thought , teaching as we have seen to be a light unto oneself , which in turn fits the new paradigm .\nAstrology offers precious guidelines for the years to come : it tells us we are seeds of meaning planted by the cosmos and that our vocation is to blossom .\nThis has little to do with becoming rich , powerful or famous , or whatever society would have us believe .\nIf one succeeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ever know about it .\nBut thriving as a free individual will dramatically impact the collective consciousness , which remains our main objective if we want the world to change .\nThe main purpose of astrology is not to describe a psychological landscape\u2014which it truly does with an amazing precision\u2014or to predict good or bad weather attending our future , but to lead us on the path to the inner revolution .\nWe are talking about a Uranian revolution , which is not a slow modification taking generations to show its effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSaturn , the planet of time , implies slow transformation through patience , determination and perseverance .\nAnd we obviously need Saturn to think deeply , build , structure , and consolidate .\nBut at this time we desperately need a Uranian blaze of intelligence , an almost instantaneous understanding , which astrology does provide in many ways .\nConsidering our vital needs in these troubled times , astrology appears as a coherent philosophical system that incites us to independence of thought , the pursuit of self-development and the flowering of destiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inner quest rather than from a religion , and could well prove to be one of the keys to the emerging spirituality of the third millennium .\n[ 1 ] According to the Philosopher Karl Jaspers , the Axial Age was characterized , by the emergence of new ways of thinking in religion and philosophy in China , Persia , India , and the GrecoRoman world .\n[ 2 ] In L \u2019 astrologie et la

Vision 1947-2016", "content": "The world was shocked and saddened to hear of legendary musician David Bowie passing away January 10 , two days after his 69th birthday .\nMillions of fans would agree that David Bowie was one of the greatest , most audacious , multi-talented rock stars ever .\nHe was Ziggy Stardust , the Thin White Duke , the Rebel Rebel , Aladdin Sane ( A Lad Insane ) , A Starman and Spaceman an androgynous , chameleon , actor , producer , artist , joker , husband , father and much more .\nWith a high profile career that lasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched many generations .\nHis 28th studio album , BLACKSTAR , was released on his 69th Birthday January 8th to great critical acclaim .\nBowie , as we know had been secretly battling liver cancer for the last 18 months and had been off the world scene for quite a few more .\nHis leaving legacy the album Blackstar bravely explores the themes of death and dying throughout with lines like : \u201c I can \u2019 t give everything away .\nI know there is something very wrong \u201d \u2013 Can \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuck did Monday go ?\n\u201c \u2013 Girl Loves me \u201c With skull designs on my shoes \u201d \u2013 Can \u2019 t give everything away For those of us that listened to the album and watched the videos before finding out about the death of our rock star and hero , we knew something was up !\nAfter the news , it seemed at first that his whole leaving the planet was so well planned and thought out , that he couldn \u2019 t have just died 2 days after the release of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his next piece of art , so spooky , frightening and profoundly symbolic .\nAt first it seemed that maybe euthanasia was involved as he timed his death so perfectly in the end .\nYet apparently no , as his producer Tony Visconti has said , that since last November , David didn \u2019 t know if he had 4 weeks or 4 months left to live , yet was planning to produce another song .\nHis strength and health declined rapidly in the last two days after his birthday and release of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His was cremated , with no ceremony and wanted to be remembered for his songs , not his funeral and his haunting and touching parting gift .\n\u201c Look up here , I \u2019 m in heaven I \u2019 ve got scars that can \u2019 t be seen Everybody knows me now Look up here , man , I \u2019 m in danger I \u2019 ve got nothing left to lose \u201d \u2013 Lazarus The lazarus video shows Bowie on a hospital bed with bandaged eyes , writhing around singing \u201c Look up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d .\nThe biblical story of lazarus is that of Jesus bringing Lazarus back to life , telling his followers that \u201c This sickness will not end in death \u201d sending us a message , that this is not the end , but another beginning , although a sad one .\nAs the video concludes with Bowie spookily backing up into a wardrobe you know he is not well .\nEven in death his natal Jupiter in Scorpio in the 9th house of beliefs and philosophy , Scorpio the sign of transformation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nJupiter in Scorpio is in loose sextile to his Mars and Sun , ( some might say unaspected ) bringing more depth , intensity to the picture .\nhttps : //www.youtube.com/watch ?\nv=y-JqH1M4Ya8 In the Blackstar video we see an eclipsed landscape , a dead spaceman , a jewel encrusted skull and a single burning flame .\nThe hypnotic surreal De Chirico landscape of the video , we discover the fate of Major Tom who became a beautiful mysterious bejewelled skull , and was honoured as a shamanic totem throughout the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives reference to a solar eclipse or a dying star , about to be reborn .\nThe Black Star can also be seen as the Black Sun , another word for Saturn in esoterica .\nSaturn \u2019 s metal lead , alchemically , is the prima matera , or primal matter , that represents the putrefaction and decay necessary for new life .\nSaturn also known as the grim reaper who carries the scythe of death in his hands .\nDavid Bowie has the Moon , Saturn and Pluto conjunct in creative Leo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruled by planet Saturn as well as his Aquarian ascendent .\nThe last Solar Eclipse before his death was on September 13 , 2015 and was at 20 degrees Virgo , in Bowie \u2019 s 8th house of death , squaring his Uranus at his North Node in the 4th house of endings , and sextile his Jupiter in Scorpio in his 9th house , whilst making a magical quintile to his Midheaven .\nHe knew it was coming , he was staring death in the face and created an amazing and final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ //www.youtube.com/watch ?\nv=kszLwBaC4Sw These last works are provocative , prophetic , fresh and disturbing all at once , inventive and fearless , yet somehow more magnificent now that we know the reason for them .\nAs Bowie was staring death in the face , he shared his leaving with his fans as a final potent , prophetic piece of ART .\nBy examining David Bowies astrology chart , which many of us have now done as a tribute to the great legend , we can see how his astrology was a living breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many hit songs and lyrics are revealed in his astrology chart .\nDiscovering these connections makes us further realise as astrologers , how powerful the archetypal symbols of the planets , signs and houses are , in defining our characters and who we will become .\nFor example , Venus is Bowie \u2019 s most elevated planet being the closest to the Midheaven the part of the chart that shows us what we aspire to be the most and what potentially we will be known for .\nWell yes , he became famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a mega fashion icon , a leader in fashion trends , of being different , of following his own road .\nIt all seemed so natural for him , he was just doing what he loved .\nHis media and video \u2019 s of course broke new ground in so many areas , MTV , the digital world , sound experimentation came together as his unique Art .\nVenus rules what we love , like and want and what or who we are passionate about , as well as art , artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had that unforgettable , most unique and powerful voice .\nVenus rules the voice and throat .\nIn Sagittarius and in the 9th house Venus is was also the visionary , way ahead of her time , future oriented , with a focus on the meaning and philosophy of life , knowledge , the truth .\nFor Bowie we see Venus in Sagittarius takes on the freedom to move boldly into the future , to be the gypsy , the metaphysician , the world traveler , the androgynous tart wearing latex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one who married an exotic Somalian supermodel goddess , Iman .\nWith VENUS in Sagittarius right on his world midheaven , the FAME spot in a chart , one of his top 10 hits was the song called Fame and other romantic , sensitive and touching songs we remember so well : Fame Golden Years Sorrow Heroes Sound and Vision China Girl Suffragette City David Bowie , was a Capricorn Sun , born David Robert Jones on January 8 , 1947 in Brixton , London U.K. We are using the Birth Time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found on astro.com website .\nThis birth time , after studying life transits and other aspects of this chart seems quite spot on ( Julija ) .\nOther birth times floating around are 9:10am or.9:15am , which move Bowie \u2019 s Leo Moon from the 7th to the 6th house , which I find takes away from the power of angularity ( the angular houses have more impact in our astrology charts being in 1st,4th,7th,10th , as planets on angles also command more influence ) of the Moon in Leo strong on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reinforces the showmanship and popularity of the man , with the Moon also in trine to Venus and the Midheaven .\nAll perfectly fitting for Bowie \u2019 s persona and his life lived ( we will explore this more in Part 2 of this article ) His 3 degree Aquarius Ascendant , Venus in Sagittarius on the Midheaven , Uranus in Gemini , Jupiter in the 9th house and all Leo planets describe his visionary , rebellious and daring signature , a revolutionary , higher-consciousness being .\nHis androgynous appearance and proclaimed bi-sexuality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which opened many to sexual taboos during the 70 \u2019 s , inviting us all somehow to be a unique individual and just who we wanted to be .\nThe symbol of lightning , a symbol belonging to the sky Gods , Uranus and Jupiter , freedom and rebellion and bringing in the new and fresh ideas , became one of the most famous icons for Bowie , boldly adorning Bowie \u2019 s face on the 1973 \u2019 s \u201c ALADDIN SANE \u201d album cover .\nNow a lightning Bolt constellation has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stemming from the fixed Star Spica within the constellation of Virgo .\nThe astronomers who picked the stars for the constellation write : \u201c Refer to his various albums , we chose seven stars \u2014 Sigma Librae , Spica , Alpha Virginis , Zeta Centauri , SAA 204 132 , and the Beta Sigma Octantis Trianguli Australis \u2014 in the vicinity of Mars.\n\u201d Although strangely , the vicinity of Mars will soon be changing , this is where Mars is now in the sidereal landscape and but will be moving on .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mars , and nevertheless it will always remind us where Mars was at the time that Bowie left the planet .\nhttp : //www.abc.net.au/news/2016-01-18/david-bowie-astronomers-pay-tribute-with-constellation/7094720 .\nCurrently Spica in the tropical zodiac is at 23\u00b0 Libra right on the cusp of Bowies 8th and 9th house using the Porphyry house system .\nWe \u2019 ll never think of Virgo holding a sheath of wheat anymore , but perhaps now also the lightning bolt to higher realms .\n( Please note this naming of the constellation has recently been debunked , but not sure maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bowie \u2019 s ascendant we also find asteroid Pallas Athena , a somewhat androgynous female in mythology , born fully grown from the head of Jupiter , without a mother , who became the wise mentor , strategist and advisor to war and of heroes .\nShe was widely worshipped and Athens was named after her , she was a goddess of culture , arts and crafts , bringing the gifts of weaving and the Olive Tree to the

ruler of Aquarius ( traditional Saturn ) is in his 4th house , the house of his roots and upbringing , in GEMINI , the sign of the twins , conjunct to the North Node .\nHe was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do things

David \u2019 s half brother , was diagnosed as a manic depressive and schizophrenic and suicided when David was 38 .\nA Gemini North Node focuses on communicating , media and remaining intellectually

house of partners , money , power and transformation is in trine aspect to Uranus and his North node , bringing in the fantasy , inventiveness , otherworldliness and super creative energy that was this man .\nWe hear many of these themes in songs like : \u201c REBEL , REBEL , you \u2019 ve torn your dress , Rebel Rebel , your face is a mess , rebel rebel , how could they know , hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rebel Rebel \u201d Ziggy played guitar , jamming good with Weird and Gilly , And The Spiders from Mars .\nHe played it left hand , but made it too far , Became the special man , Then we were Ziggy

his music , the chameleon-like person ever changing and tells of his struggles with addictions and his deeply creative , yet worldly wise spiritual side , ( together with Neptune in the 8th house , and Jupiter in Scorpio ) .\nThe 12th house is connected to the shamanic dreamtime , deception , illusion , magic , the genius and the insane , all of which feature in his art .\n\u201c ALADDIN @ @ @ @

with the drive for self expression .\nDavid was an astute business man who protected the copyright of his music and invested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well and had a long and prosperous career .\nDavid \u2019 s Moon is conjunct retrograde Saturn and retrograde Pluto in Leo in his 7th house of others in our life , loves and marriage and this powerful combination indicates a past life karma of commanding power .\nPluto is in harmonious aspect to his nodal axis and shows how he used his personality , Leo , what he felt right doing , Moon to structure an empowered life that was his , Saturn , and become a world changing individual , Pluto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so revered in his death .\nOf course his whole life was not a walk in the park , but filled with many ups and downs , extremes and personal tests .\nDavid was every inch the actor , a larger than life hero to many , a royal star a showman who refused a knighthood from the Queen , twice .\nHe possessed an intense obsessive drive to creatively express himself and to be successful in his own right .\nSaturn rules his 12th house Sun and his Aquarius ascendant , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visionary that could ground his visions and became a leader in his field .\nHe seemed to burn with passion by doing so .\nSaturn , Pluto and Moon themes come across in these songs in various ways : \u201c The Man who sold the world \u201d Perfectly describes

We seek a renewed stirring of life for the earth .\nWe plead that what we are capable of doing is not always what we ought to do .\nWe urge that all people now determine to testify that this generation has love for the next .\nIf we want to succeed in that , we might show , meanwhile , a little more love for this one , and for each other .\nDuring this time of great imbalance you may feel torn between the priorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family \u2019 ( resolving your own inner spiritual , psychological or physical problems ) and attempting to cure the social and economic ills that beset our global culture .\nThere is not a person alive that is immune from engaging in inner work , healing and attempting to alter the level of awareness to which they were initial born , this attitude misses a hugely significant point .\nIt perpetuates the myth of separation continues to view you as an individual , as somehow isolated from the rest of the world .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with momentum over many millennia , ever since we stopped moving with the seasons and rooted ourselves in OUR patch of land .\nThat movement coincided with the balance of the scales tipping towards a Yang approach to life .\nThe imposition of mind over body which led to the cultivation of land in a manner out of sync with Nature , was only the harbinger of the world we now live in , a world that swung violently towards a disconnected , isolated and secular culture .\nTechnology , which has offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us of life itself .\nOur society \u2019 s detachment from nature , our war against the microbiome , our unrelenting hunger to correlate growth with material abundance and the virulence of the most destructive pathogen of them all \u2013 capitalism has destroyed our diverse ecosystem , our concept of community and our vitality .\nThe beautiful gift of the \u2018 go-slow \u2019 in Spring 2020 was to observe what life can be and how Nature can thrive if truly honour rhythm \u2013 a time for pause and a time for action .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the confronting the reality of the health of your reality and looking at yourself and your life in a mirror , more time in stillness , in nature and in an awareness of what human connectivity truly means .\nIt reminded those of us old enough , of what life was like before the advent of a global , 24/7 , techno-economy .\nOur connection to nature , to our own bodies , to our relationships increased in awareness .\nIt was a reminder of what is important \u2013 a truth that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no doubt that we are moving through the early stages of a death-rebirth cycle within humanity , and as written about previously , we are also collectively moving through a massive redistribution of power , a movement that does occur infrequently throughout time .\nThe desire to return to normal for many is certainly something akin to downing cod liver oil or spreading marmite on their toast .\nHave we really lived within a democracy ?\nHas \u2018 wealth \u2019 brought a better quality of life ?\nHas the speed to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly constitutes health and well-being ?\nWhat is real and what is fabrication ?\nIndigenous wisdom has , for many years , been seen as outdated , especially since it appears less \u2018 technical \u2019 .\nAnd yet , one simple ubiquitous truth arising from these nature-connected cultures , a truth deeply apparent as a consequence of the spread of \u2018 covid \u2019 , is that of holism .\nWithout exploring the Machiavellian \u2018 conspiratorial \u2019 dimension of a \u2018 locked \u2019 down \u2018 western \u2019 world , it is impossible to deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , separate , elite beings above and better than Nature .\nWe , you , are utterly inseparable to this living Earth and if you accept that reality , then you must also recognise that isolated health and well-being is an illusion .\nHealing yourself and working to resolve the contradictions in the human-Earth ecology is one and the same work .\nAll healing involves making whole again \u2013 resolving the contradictions that exist between self and other , body and spirit , mind and nature .\nYou are not an encapsulated self-enclosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of energy integrated with the environment .\nEverything you do transforms and reshapes the world .\nEverything .\nThis is the basic teachings of Hermeticism and Gnosticism , and the central tenat of astrological philosophy \u2013 the world within you is reflect in the world outside of you ; the world outside of you is a reflection of the world inside of you , to paraphrase Hermes Trismegistus \u2019 aphorism .\nIf your actions can destroy , so can they heal .\nIn this light there is no difference between work and prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work of the spirit .\nPrecisely in the restoration of this balance between body and spirit lies the path for the healing the greater whole .\nAll prayer is ultimately an act of hope .\nWithout hope it has no substance .\nHope empowers your intention and gives character to your action .\nHope is a light-force , which radiates pervasively and directs your creative and spiritual evolution towards your world \u2019 s future .\nWhile your action may be turned aside from its purpose or taken over by the milieu in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is genuine , can not be taken over .\nIt attains its goals because it is its goal .\nAnd it is my prayer for the coming months that nothing and no-one diminishes your hope and your light and that you have the freedom to direct your light into the world .\nTo paraphrase the architect and engineer Buckminster Fuller : we can not change things by fighting the existing realty .\nWhat is required is that we build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete .\nAnd this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to actively build a new model of reality , after all is the other model something that enables the individual , the family unit , community to truly thrive ?\nThere is literally nothing life affirming about our fast paced reality ; our education model encourages repetition and memory retention ; our economic model encourages futurism , isolationism and exhaustion ; we live for the weekends ; we live in debt ; and we live without a true democracy .\nBut there is nothing about the energetic conditions that we are all living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that normality .\nAfter all the truth of any new beginning is also the truth of something passing and death in itself .\nAnd there is no mistaking the fundamental truth of our world disconnection from the rhythm of nature \u2013 our terror of death .\nA terror that has motivated society to find countless ways of \u2018 cheating \u2019 death , of keeping death at bay , of denying the normality of death and of making death a failure .\nOne of the most beautifully written books on death that I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Potter .\nIt is explicitly encoded in the Tale of the Three Brothers , a fairy tale recounted by the fictional Hermione Ganger as the search for the three objects that can grant immortality unfolds .\nEmma Watson \u2019 s narration of that tale can be found at the following YouTube page \u2013 https : //www.youtube.com/watch ?\nv=bN1_h_eGitE Conceived and birthed through a Sun-Moon-Pluto soul , J. K. Rowling , Harry Potter is a story to help children ( and adults ) better understand the grieving process , a process that extends far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the protagonist is made an orphan by a deeply tragic character hell bent on seeking immortality .\nPotter \u2019 s journey is one of loss , grief and trauma , made whole by love , fellowship and community , qualities sorely lacking in our modern western world and for me the most reprehensible facet of the intentional isolation policy of most governments , under the guise of public health and well-being .\nOur patriarchal influenced one-sided obsession with the bright , luminous colours have excluded us from the holism of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly hope we , as a world , confronts in the months ahead .\nIt is poignant to reflect that the first lunation of 2021 , not only falls in the zodiacal sign of Cardinal Earth , a sign associated with the \u2018 creation of reality \u2019 , but also in tight alignment with Pluto , a planetary archetype symbolising the concept of regeneration and also with Chiron , an archetype reflecting healing .\nEncoded within this initial lunation is that of the deep healing of the ancestral amnesia that has prevented us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother Gaia to co-create with us our health and well-being .\nAs mentioned above , the first step of many that is required is to take care of our own immediate health and well-being , and that does not simply mean dieting and taking medication to keep well .\nWell-being is a deeper conversation , especially when we consider that ANY pharma-product has side effects that Nature Herself does not possess .\nAny artificially created drug has to come with disclaimers simply because it focuses on one particular facet of illness and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hope that in 2021 more people step away from the illusion of the external reality that we have been living in , and start truly addressing their own personal realities , focusing on the health and well-being of that system .\nAfter all , your reality is also reflective of the external reality , and what you \u2018 create \u2019 , echoes through and around you .\nYou can , as the indigenous once said , make a difference .\nThe healing that you do on yourself , impacts those immediately in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It creates ripples and in time ripples become waves , and \u2026 you get the picture .\nThe conditions are ripe for this sea change .\nThe movement towards a New Earth has been long coming and as a new reality dawns ( amidst the collapse and death of the old system ) the question will be what , in time , that consensus reality will look like .\nI do not envision that reality happening overnight , as they said \u2013 Rome was not made in a day \u2013 but I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toxins that have been brought to the surface can only truly be healed by you , the individual , and not by an external agency .\nThis time , for me , is one of deep empowerment , as we , the people , are being confronted with our own sovereignty and part of the Saturn-Uranus square of mid Feb , June and late December 2021 will be a reminder of the necessity to speak forth regarding the violation of your sovereign rights .\nThis is a deeply powerful time .\nBut remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world at this time .\nThe way in which our world is being birthed is in your hands .\nMy best wishes to you with the choices you will make this calendar year .\nThanks for taking the time to read this month \u2019 s offering", "author": "Andrew Smith", "url": "https://cosmicintelligenceagency.com/newmooncapricorn/",

planets currently stirs up noble concerns for others , whomever they may be , lover , boss , best friend , betrothed , old friend , new friend , stranger , colleague or neighbour , or even that sly old scraggy fox still lurking on the corner : everyone needs to know where they belong .\nTo whom , or to what is another question .\nBut having a strong network , with an interconnection to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empower our deeper , authentic self , and set us free \u2013 in true Aquarian style \u2013 to explore our own talents , however cute or foxy they may be .\nThough with Venus in Capricorn ( at the very same degree it will be at the end of 2021 ! )\nit \u2019 s a Silver Fox who exudes seductive power during this arty and creative Full Leo Moon .\nAll-the-while a gathering of Aquarian planets indicates humanity \u2019 s sense of oneness can awaken the globalized soul into a New Age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in various Full Moon reports this is a long-term project : a goal from which we should never lose sight , because it IS achievable .\nAs such , this first Full Moon of 2021 holds sincere humanitarian promise \u2013 along with very real and earthy Taurean issues of our environmental , financial , food and security challenges to which we need to be undeterred in tackling .\nAnd why Taurus is mentioned up top is because the ruler of Aquarius , the planet of peer-groups and astrology , Uranus , is currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interestingly , developing the will to stay on course \u2013 and act on behalf of others \u2013 is symbolic of dramatic fixity and focus , as shown in January 28th \u2019 s Full Leo Moon horoscope .\nOn the upside , taking care of others builds trust and confidence which also enhances our own mental wellbeing ; being altruistic is factually win/win , shown to also improve personal happiness as well as positively impact upon other \u2019 s lives .\nAquarius is the zodiac sign associated with altruism and by extension so is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within friendship circles also ensures support when needed .\n\u2730 Be aware how the initial days of the waxing Full Moon might again seem tough and trying , as though nothing really changes when the Sun conjuncts Time Lord Saturn \u2013 only again to remind of karma and its consequences .\nKeep the faith .\nHours after Luna \u2019 s culmination , when both Sun AND Moon then connect to magnanimous and lucky Jupiter , breakthroughs and confidence abounds ; so when helping and collaborating in the run up to this fiery Leo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the profound Aquarian Sun is in conjunction with both taskmaster Saturn , generous Jupiter , strategist Pallas Athena AND informative Mercury .\nThere may even be a sudden revelation ( within the planning ) just after the Full Moon , all of which can favourably encourage cooperation and personal transformation that breaks old ( thought ) patterns , and thus a hidden weight could unexpectedly be lifted from various shoulders .\nPerhaps it \u2019 s as simple as changing the way we look at things for our attitudes to change too .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may also be due to a warm inner glow that comes from the blessings of a generously Full and fiery Leo Moon that accents the brave human heart and bright soul .\nIt \u2019 s true a Full Leo Moon stirs competitive ambitions and pride , but with regal , lively and warm-hearted playfulness taking the lead and attracting friends and admirers with an uplifting sense of creative fun .\n\u2730 Before any crowning moment goes to anyone \u2019 s head , take note now of important upcoming astral activity : Mercury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still zap over this Full Moon , coming to a full stop a few days after Lunar \u2019 s culmination .\nWhile holding the collective emotional experience can dominate in the sign of the \u2018 Water Bearer \u2019 , Aquarius also has a singular intellectual brilliance , one that dazzles with ingenuity and personal genius .\nIf you also need to stop and take time out to reflect recent events and situations before further committing to anything idealistic , far-out or group-orientated , factor in that on 30th January Mercury goes into retrograde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feb , when it reaches 11\u00b0 Aquarius , and when the Sun moves into Pisces , and a First Quarter Moon is in Gemini , which is ruled by Mercury : networking ideas and team strategy in the radical Aquarian hive mind could initially be on overtime with ideas and thoughts zapping into consciousness at the speed of light .\nBe aware : wishing thinking also runs amok when Mercury is in Aquarius .\nOn a practical note , Aquarian cooperation and organisation is key to successful interaction as well as making it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( virtual ) office ) : back-up important info and note how ( tech ) problems and/or communicating with others could mean repeating and familiarising ( everyone , including yourself ) until a message is clear .\nShould you find yourself in electronic melt-down , take heed and comfort in the words of my 17-year-old Goddess Girl who blithely informed \u2018 Everything is digital now.\n\u2019 Okay .\nCheck .\nThen she added \u2018 But nothing works properly.\n\u2019 !\nKnowing perfection doesn \u2019 t exist and that something always goes a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means we can relax \u2013 but still seek and apply solutions as and when .\nAlso worth bearing in mind is that due to Mercury \u2019 s retrograde , Mercury and Jupiter meet three times to indicate BIG IDEAS are now potentially more receptive when proposed .\nStill , watch expectations .\nAnd think back to January 11th ; check to see what was new for you at that point in time and still is something you can learn from ; then look ahead to a decidedly funky Valentine when those ideas are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when whatever it was that began around the January New Moon will either show areas of growth , improvement , or could even have blown up out of all proportion , in which case you may decide that a good time was worth it , and take the lessons learned into Equinox .\n\u2730 March is around the corner , preceded by February 11th \u2019 s Lunar New Year of the Metal Ox ( or Iron Bull as it is also known ) which is two weeks after this Full Leo Moon .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the OX .\nAnd whilst being aware of present personal responsibilities at work , as well as at home , with friends , faith and debating the future it \u2019 s also worth bearing in mind how , particularly over this Full Leo Moon , it is an excellent moment to take care of our own needs and apply metaphorical bandaid wherever and however necessary , especially to those emotional wounds , perhaps feeling alienated or just plain frazzled and over stimulated .\nPlease stay safe , no matter how strong the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rules may be .\n\u2730 Watch out also for restless , rash behaviour that could lead to major accidents .\n\u2018 The Lights \u2019 , Sun & Moon , are in a hard \u2018 Fixed \u2018 T \u2019 Square \u2019 that challenges the rather exciting and fairly rare conjunction between dynamic Mars and Uranus ( every two years ) , for surprising events/relationships/situations to come from left-field is typical of this configuration .\nExpect the unexpected .\nAnd think outside the box .\nBoth Mars and Uranus are now in Earthy Taurus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and refreshing advances with healthy returns .\n\u2730 With all our individual quirks and idiosyncrasies contributing to the greater whole , never has being a \u2018 world server \u2019 been a more fitting and liberating call to answer .\nEver since the Sun entered Aquarius on the 19th January , it added to an electrical buzz already zapping our world ; as such we especially need to take care of frazzled nervous systems .\nThese continue to be testing times , not just from having been on information assault for over a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c/19 onslaught , among other issues , but adjusting to current extremes requires us to cajole our darker or more radical thoughts into the light and onto the more peaceful middle way .\nThankfully the bright and buzzy , scientifically future-orientated Aquarian Sun is now with expansive Jupiter , making this a Full Moon to be confident in outlook and optimism our watchword .\n\u2730 A last Lunar aspect to consider is how both Sun and Moon make an easy and harmonious connection to outsider shamanic wounded healer , Chiron , making this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who have fire signs ( Aries , Leo & Sagittarius ) prominent .\n\u2730 And lastly , I would like to mention how this socially active and creative Full Moon is still subject to the repressive distancing Saturn in Aquarius can symbolise .\nSaturn remains in Aquarius until March 2023 , which is a mighty long time to be wearing masks , worrying about \u2018 bubbles \u2019 and Granny .\nHopefully , the world will not be so distant and strange for the entire duration of Saturn \u2019 s stay and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In any event a combination of thoughtful determination and a willingness to turn selfishness into selflessness will signal a brighter future .\nWith that , I wish you all a roaring and creative and socially satisfying Full Leo Moon\u2026 With love and light , Laura # 87 aka AstroDakini \u00a9 And still\u2026 \u201c I think what everyone should be doing , before it \u2019 s too late , is committing themselves to what they really want to do with their lives.\n\u201d ~ Matthieu Ricard", "author": "Agent12 Julija", "url": "https://cosmicintelligenceagency.com/full-moon-leo/", "published": "Fri, 22 Jan 2021 23:27:04 +0000",

waiting in the sky He \u2019 s told us not to blow it Cause he knows it \u2019 s all worthwhile Aquarius iconography is a curiosity since it is often depicted as a young , beautiful man pouring water onto the earth from the sky above .\nForgiven , you are , for thinking that it is a water sign , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereignty of your inner thoughts , ideas and voice , as it is composed of two energetic states \u2013 the realm of Ruach , or gOd \u2019 s breath and fixity , or the sanctity of the inner world .\nThe image of the Water Bearer has always hinted at the agency of transformation from ideal to real , as the waters of consciousness , those formless liminal images , flow forth from the womb of humanity to replenish , nourish and ultimately inspire our everyday consciousness .\nYet , there has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with \u2018 space \u2019 or with a vaster consciousness beyond not only our human but also those who exist within our immediate god realm .\nThis is especially so for the iconography with in The Star , the card traditionally used to teach non-literates astrology through the Tarot .\nThe current interpretation of Aquarius \u2019 link with space comes from its patriarchal rulership connection with the 13th of March 1781 discovery of Uranus and astrologers designation of this planetary archetype with the sign of Aquarius , dethroning Kronos , or Saturn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gateway to the Akashi , is highly electrical in nature and apparently opens the doors to the future , the relationship with space has , confusingly , been deemed the dominion of a sign that is more about the exploration of the inner space , than that of outer space .\nBut Aquarius pre-dates this discovery , therefore hinting that \u2018 alien \u2019 consciousness is something that is innate within our psyche .\nMany mythological stories attributed to Aquarius , correlate spacebeings and the Water Bearer particularly that of the oft misunderstood story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nDescending from the sky above on an Eagle , the god of gods Zeus , took this striking beautiful young man from his life on the Earth and brought him to live with the gods in Olympus .\nDeeply enchanted by the depth and wealth of his mind , Zeus bestowed upon Ganymede the privilege of being his cupbearer .\nBut tension arose within the gOdrealm as other gOds were threatened by this Christ-like figure ( man yet gOd ) and together they colluded in a totally unique manner .\nGanymede was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dismembered and cast asunder into the darker underworlds , as befit most outcasts of the Grecian stories !\nThe cupbearer , whose job it is to protect the gOds , now becomes the intermediary between the godrealm and those that exist beyond these terrestrial planes of consciousness \u2013 a realm illustrated in astrology by that of the Fixed Star realm \u2013 and thus forging a connection in consciousness between the higher and lower skies .\nIs this alien consciousness something external to us , or is a much deeper , more ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose form is proto-humanoid , upon which our limited imaginations project ?\nIs it alien because it is our own inner , unchartered voice and mind ?\nIf we look for other hints in the Ganymede story , we can explore the meaning of Ganymede \u2019 s name .\n\u2018 Gan \u2019 comes from Ganesh , the Hindu god who removes obstacles from our path so we can move forward .\n\u2018 Mede \u2019 also comes from the Vedas and means the middle , or the median connection between two differing states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depiction of that mediation process that is the inner activity who sets all in motion , and the contemplation , the final cause , who draws towards himself all that which is in movement ?\nHe is primordial action and eternal waiting .\nMoreover , as half human and half god and as the protector of the gods , Ganymede , or Aquarius , symbolises the ability to remove toxins from that which feeds our connection to the godrealm and from the godrealm to a deeper source consciousness ( alien ) , whilst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incarnate form of the gods within humanity \u2013 that we are both god and human , as well as alien and human .\nIf we look more closely at the glyph of Aquarius , we see two parallel waves , which has historically been depicted as the waters flowing forth from the urns .\nHowever , for me they have always looked like two \u2018 wavelengths \u2019 , along with our consciousness operates .\nUltimately our consciousness moves beyond space and time , extending up and out into the far reaches of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deeper realms of the inner worlds that exist within each individual .\nThese two wave forms could be seen as Samsara and Nirvana and they co-exist , mirroring each other , apparently separate but ultimately synchronised , seeking to become unified , ultimately marrying the phenomenal world with that of the experiential .\nIt is my belief that the two wave forms that are outlined in the Aquarian glyph reflect the parallel existence of this physical plane and the interior plane ; the god plane and the human plane ; and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realm and the god realm that we seek to experience as humans .\nAs the external world mirrors the internal world and as the internal world mirrors the developments of consciousness within the external world , it is curious to note that as we dive deeper into the origins of our personal consciousness , we are also stretching up and out beyond this plane of existence and exploring what is our humanity with the rise in AI and also with our extra-terrestrial brethren .\nIs there life beyond this realm ?\nI believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThere are too many mythological stories and legends that point to the co-existence of humanity and other non-terrestrial consciousness \u2019 s for that to be discounted .\nHowever , as we move deeper within our own consciousness , we also encounter \u2018 alien \u2019 perspectives and insights that create massive quantum shifts in awareness and growth .\nThe movement within merely mirrors the movement without , and I \u2019 ve often mused about the starpeople over the years and wondered if we really journey through space as opposed to into space\u2026 In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper forms of consciousness that extend much further into time and space than what our rational or irrational minds can understand .\nIt is fascinating to observe the increased emergence of stories of encounters beyond the known of late and wonder at what that truly means in terms of a humanity that still struggles with gender and equality and with acceptance and compassion , let alone with accepting the unseen and seen worlds !\nBut it is equally marvellous to observe the deeper possibility of these \u2018 encounters \u2019 as a confirmation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inspirational consciousness arising beyond our normal experience that can shed a light on facilitating our necessity to find alternative solutions beyond those previously postulated to help us out of the deeply grooved rut of the disconnected duality that runs parallel without true dialogue .\nGanymede poured the agency of growth ( water ) from the stars ( deeper consciousness ) onto the earth ( our physical world ) to awaken the spark of life and to create a deeper awareness of the importance of dreams , the Angelics and \u2018 space \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurs not externally , but internally , and therefore the Fixed Air consciousness , or Aquarian realm , is that of the continuity of hope ( a light force that moves and directs spiritual evolution in the mind ) and life .\nI always wanted you to go", "author": "Andrew Smith", "url": "https://cosmicintelligenceagency.com/newmoonaquarius2021/",

feminine sign of the zodiac Virgo , as she does over this Full Moon , we all ( male & female alike ) tend to get busy , attending to this and that with the kind of great practicality that only an insightful , female kind of wisdom \u2013 rationally intuitive \u2013 successfully works .\nWhich means for those who are currently adrift in the Sun \u2019 s Piscean sea , swimming and surfing the cosmic ocean with alternate waves of chaos , anxiety and/or confusion , it is time to get ready and be hustled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto Terra Firma for a potentially life-changing , life-affirming , practical and logical , Full Moon in Virgo experience .\nWhen the lessons of this Full Moon are assimilated \u2013 that within every human there is a naturally radiating divine human spirit , it could even bring about a full-scale planetary awareness \u2013 one that raises a collective consciousness .\nBeing aware how we are essentially One with the universe also means all beings can be helped , healed and served as only the Virgoan influence can , with vigour and virtue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is also the Moon to purify mind , body and spirit .\nHarness the moment and make a practical effort to be rid of weighty thoughts or extra pounds before heading into the next season .\nTraining the mind or weights ( or both ! )\n, now is the time to create order within ; in the mind ( do your best to eliminate stress , along with any destructive emotions ) ; within the body ( look after yourself : exercise , nourish with good food , fresh air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be watchful in what is spoken : for every word has its own magical vibration , humming with incantations .\nMake it easy for everyone and go with words , people , and ideas that fill your heartmind with hope \u2013 and love .\nKeep it light .\nTouch the Earth .\nHold a flower .\nTalk to animals .\nGo squirrel rogue and hug a tree if you need to hug in a socially distant world .\nI know it \u2019 s not the same as the human touch we all instinctively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our wisest feminine of which the zodiac \u2019 s earthy Virgin is a heavenly embodiment of a sign that respects healthy regimes , polished presentations , and sensible smarts .\nThe weekend \u2019 s Virgo Moon therefore encourages our ( inner ) sage-woman wisdom to nurture our awakening inner light and kindle flames which sate powerfully deep and meaningful thoughts and emotions that enrich and heal the very core of our soul .\n\u2730 Bear in mind how this Full Moon is the culmination of a lunation which began infused with the excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Golden Metal Ox ( February 12th ) , and the amazing 6-planet line-up in wishful Aquarius .\nMetaphorically speaking , the Metal Ox ploughs ahead in a clear and incisive manner , the furrow in which we can plant our wish-fulfilling seeds .\nThroughout 2021 , and in order to keep our path clear and obstacle free , we need to be artful and responsible , helpful and aware ; thoughtful in word , deed and intention , for all to flourish as it should .\nBe aware how certain seeds can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from two minutes to two hundred years .\nInstant karma happens all the time .\nWhile long-term thinking is certainly necessary with some aspects of Earth \u2019 s healing \u2013 particularly for our water and the soulful elemental which rules Pisces , the sign from which our Sun now radiates upon the Earthy Full Virgo Moon .\n\u2730 The Sun is also with an exalted Venus .\nIn the sign of the fish , Venus is in the position in which the astral Love Goddess emanates with unconditional love : loving kindness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential ( to get through June & July ) to go with the flow , and for self-love and confidence to shine wholeheartedly .\nVenus is also conjunct Fixed Star , \u2018 Fomalhaut \u2019 , which in ancient days indicated an all-important quest , in which ethics and morality must be kept intact for the quest to be fulfilled ( easier for Virgo than Pisces , it must be said ) .\nThe quest in this case is to keep growing the ( self ) love and forgiveness , as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially to the Goddess ( within ) ) .\n\u2730 Our Virgo Goddess is not alone at culmination , and for a few days after , Luna is conjunct Asteroid Vesta , Goddess of the Hearth and Sacred Flame .\nVesta is central to the warmth within the home .\nChaste and youthful , Vesta is associated with the fertile and devotional side of Virgo , showing how to commit and respond more easily to daily challenges with an enthusiastic approach , especially regarding self-confidence and sexuality , that is with a natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe and friendly , love and care into our lives .\nInterestingly , Vesta \u2019 s day of celebration in ancient Rome was March 1st , to mark a day when the Sacred Priestess ignites the sacred flame that at once protects and illuminates , right as the Virgo Moon wanes and passes Vesta .\nThe timing on these two work-ethical Goddesses coming together at Vesta \u2019 s special moment magically highlights a collective passage-cum-plight , as Vesta often indicates alienation , being locked away and separated from the world .\nAs I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world recently have or are self-isolating from a very Piscean unseen virus .\nWhile Virgo Moon and Vesta conjoin for healing to take place , it also shows how people could have become more introverted over the past year and now need to confront a potential fear of intimacy , all-the-while satisfied in the knowledge their sacrifice has been for the greater good \u2013 a bit like making a light offering in Vesta \u2019 s Temple for protection , healing and productivity .\nGoing now into Virgo Moon detail\u2026 \u2730 Both education-orientated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of planetary pattern currently holding everything together called \u2018 The Sling \u2019 , in which Vesta and the Moon , i.e.\n, our feelings about health , reactions to work , and our very souls \u2019 duty are actually being held opposite the bundle other planets and connected within an opposition to form \u2018 the sling \u2019 .\nWill these planets , Moon & Vesta in the sling , be dropped or slung ?\nWhat , if thrown , will happen ?\nWhat will they hit ?\nAstral note : aided by Vesta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Bullseye , of sorts .\n\u2730 Vesta and the Moon are also involved in no less than four different celestial shapes ; we can deduce distinctly different qualities of \u2018 energies \u2019 ranging from stressful , to smooth and calm , or utterly fated .\nVesta and the Virgo Moon \u2019 s four patterns could spark as a mix or singly : much depends upon your own planets in your own chart as to how you interact with 9\u00b0Virgo-Pisces & 16\u00b0Gemini-Sagittarius and 8\u00b0 Taurus , Aquarius and Aries .\nThe first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Moon make an opposition which is then involved in a \u2018 T-Square \u2019 to form a rare \u2018 Grand Mutable Cross \u2019 only twelve hours after the exact Full Moon .\nThis is also when the Moon reaches an important part of her monthly journey known as being \u2018 at the bends \u2019 , or the \u2018 Moon Wobble \u2019 .\nWhat this means is that Moon \u2013 and Sun AND Neptune \u2013 are in a challenging \u2018 T-Square \u2019 with the Lunar Nodes , both the destiny-fulfilling North Node ( Rahu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past-life indicator , the South Node ( Ketu ) , now in Sagittarius .\nThis suggests coming through the Sagittarian \u2018 Gate of God \u2019 into Gemini \u2019 s \u2018 Gate of HuMans \u2019 is a spiritually healing an informative affair .\nThe Gemini North Node is also conjunct Fixed Star , Rigel , \u2018 The Announcer \u2019 , which is an indication that explicitly stating future intention , goals or thoughts is timely .\nEveryone needs to hear how we are all going forward : this is a perfect mission statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sextile from the Pisces Sun , and a brilliant 120\u00b0 Trine between Vestal Moon to the astral alternative wild-card , Uranus , make this a super-enlightening opportunity for stabilising and healing friendship groups ( Did you know emotions are contagious \u2013 even online or on the phone ?\n! )\nIt may even be that someone \u2013 you ?\n\u2013 has strong passions and is feeling headstrong enough to follow their own path in order to retain perceived dignity and \u2018 sovereignty \u2019 .\n3 ) The \u2018 Finger of God \u2019 aka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Vestal Virgin Virgo Full Moon , piling on the pressure for the grieving inner child , specifically to heal childhood wounds that may be accidental or karmic .\nIt could be easier to funnel away from the point of emotional pain and utilise all feminine healing qualities mentioned above , i.e.\n, before going for prescriptions , check diet and lifestyle and therapy first .\n4 ) There is also the 144\u00b0 Bi-Quintile aspect to consider between the Moon/Vesta and Pluto , which enhances healing insight and psychic connections .\nPluto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more years .\nAnd I wanted to mention this last aspect primarily because it makes it clear how Saturn and Pluto are at last separating for all negative collective karma to also start to be more manageable , less \u2018 on top \u2019 so to speak .\nSeen from all angles as conspiratorial and controlling , thankfully we will not witness the likes of a Saturn Pluto conjunction again until 2053 , when these mega-karmic planets will conjoin in Pisces , the sign of the Fish through which the Sun currently shines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goddess Moon , now conjunct Vesta !\nSo , if you

from God \u201d Straddled between two worlds yet eternally bound to both , the Piscean archetype is the alpha and omega within the consciousness spectrum held within the zodiac belt .\nThe complexity of this fathomless realm is due to the co-existence of a liminal duality that blends Senatrix and Neonate ; Krone and infant ; Sage and Novice ; Veteran and Greenhorn , into one and the same .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrendering to a higher essence ; innocently reaching out to the world in fresh , wide-eyed abandon , whilst at the same time instinctively discerning with guile and discretion ; and emoting with such enthusiasm and time-honoured wisdom , is this \u2018 living-imaginal \u2019 sign spirit lacking embodiment or matter lacking spirit ; or is it merely able to extend across and live comfortably within those two primal states of being ?\nThe key to understanding this sign is held within its iconography and moreover within its glyph .\nPerennially associated with symbolism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glyph , for me , holds within it the deepest meaning : the two phases of the crescent Moons , spanning , yet tethered by , the incarnate plane of matter .\nHuman consciousness is the field where three kinds of light are manifest : creative light , reflected light and revealed light .\nThe first participates in the work of the creation ; the second illuminates the dark field of action of the human will ; and the last orientates us towards transcendent values and trust which constitute the ultimate criterion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all that is true in space and time .\nThat light is held within the Sun , the Moon and the stars .\nThe Moon is that reflected light , illuminating the path within , yet still bound to the plane of matter ; it is the gentle light of the interior world , the world of the imagination and the world of sOul .\nIn captivate rotational orbit with Terra , the Moon \u2019 s phases weave in and through your consciousness an undulating and vacillating pathway , ebbing and flowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you out and up and down and in .\nAs a keeper of time , the waxing crescent Moon heralds the dawn and the birth of a new world , filled with anticipation , eagerness , innocence and awe , and the fecund anticipation of that which has unlimited potential .\nThe waning crescent Moon , or balsamic Moon , on the other hand is that wily time that prepares you for death , ever encouraging you to reflect on all that has come and all that you have experienced , as stillness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local horizon splitting the Moon in two , anchoring the liminal light to this physical plane , it grounds and unifies two different states of emotional being , blending them together , and rendering them one and the same .\nEmerging out from the depth of the underworld , but not fully escaped that darkened place , the rising waxing crescent brings with it wisdom from the ancestral realm and experiential acceptance of all that is ; whereas the setting waning crescent carries a wealth of experience and insight back into the depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising awareness .\nPast and future , death and birth , conscious and unconscious , embodied and shadow , dawn and dusk bound together , all revolved around your soul , as the earth to the sun .\n\u201c I am the Alpha and Omega , the beginning and the end .\nI will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.\n\u201d Revelation 22:13 , spoken by the Ichthys , him/herself \u2013 the Christ or Fisher of Man , Yesuah or Jesus .\nThe consistency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is phenomenal , as all cultures from as early as 10,000 BCE have depicted Pisces as representing two fish lying back to back and joined across the middle , swimming in different directions \u2013 one up and out towards spirit ; the other down and across the plane of matter .\nNeither can swim apart from the other , connected are they by a \u2018 rope \u2019 .\nThere have been occasional variations of the two souls bound , the Babylonians , for example bound a bird and a fish and the Isis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primordial Elohim submerged within the deep waters of Mother-night , but in truth , the persistence of the fish imagery goes beyond the modern correlation of the \u2018 depositor \u2019 of Pisces , Neptune ( god of the Ocean ) with this sign .\nOur predecessors saw gOd in the water , as we emerged out from the waters onto land and it is there that our Essence can be rediscovered .\nWater is formless , yet is neither chaotic nor fragmented .\nIt has no shape , taking on whatever contains it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing forth from its depths innumerable dreamlike images that flow beneath the waking surface of life .\nFish are the living content of the fluid medium , making its invisible content visible .\nThey symbolise our lost participation in the unconscious world and are the focus of many a spiritual teacher \u2019 s analogies as they cast the net out to sea to draw from the Akashi pearls of wisdom .\nThey are a symbol of spiritual liberation because they show the freedom of the sOul swimming in the waters of Nirvana .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piscean Moon , felt that his painting were like dreams that could be plucked out like fish .\nPisces , or Mutable Water as it is more formally known , is where the human and the divine intersect .\nWithin this realm the challenge arises to prompt you to find a way to unite the opposites in a synthesis that includes and transcends both .\nIn other words : To be in the world but not of it .\nThis is the teaching of most of the spiritual disciplines that have arisen with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time that the slow precessional clock has been moving back through the Piscean Sign .\nIt is not an easy path and yet appears to be the way .\nGiving form to the liminal world \u2013 the youthful passion of innocent awe , with the mature awareness of devotion and dedication \u2013 is what is encoded within the glyph of Pisces , as the Crescent Moons are bound together .\nAlso honouring the transcendental , which is implicitly inherent within this sign , as Pisces is at the intersection of death and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Pisces within the esoteric tradition ) .\nIt is the crucifixion and the resurrection , as depicted within the Piscean mythology of the Christ \u2013 that shamanic initiation of dissolution , dismemberment and suffering , leading to great compassion , as your eye opens to the truth of the illusion of death and the presence of the sOul in all things .\nTo honour the transcendent means to recognise that you come from the waters of the Mother and to there you will return .\nWhen you are in touch with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce with great imagination and sOul , as much as getting pulled under into dissolution and madness .\nThe Shadow of this sign is depicted by the Greek myth of Typhon , the son of Gaia ( Earth ) and Tartarus ( the Underworld ) , the chaotic sea monster that devours life .\nThe light of this sign is the Christ , an expression of embodied enlightenment .\nAs the Sun and Moon unite within this watery sign on the 13th of March , the question arises whether you are prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a semi-conscious soul focused on a one-sided development of your consciousness , or to actively develop the \u2018 ichthys \u2019 potentiality embedded within the Piscean glyph \u2013 your consciousness is both here and now , and all and beyond ?\nWill you give form to the depths of your imagination , trusting that you are a conduit through which the sOul of the world is expressed and that your creation is not truly yours but merely comes through you , or will you continue to believe that is \u2018 air you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the world of form , ownership and possession ?\nWe live within a remarkable time and engaging in life as it has been is no longer an option .\nThe belief that matter is agency and primary is one of the biggest lies that is being slowly revealed .\nWithin this redistribution of power , the movement towards a reality that once again seeks to return to a state of innocence with a discerning wisdom , appears to be quietly underway and is particular evident in the empowerment process that most women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a space that you can make more conscious the Piscean within you and within the world at large over the coming months and I pray to the Ichthys

\u2013 2022", "content": "The Jupiter ingress into Pisces happens once every twelve years and lasts for approximately a year .\nThis transit of Jupiter in Pisces isn \u2019 t a direct route .\nDuring the next eighteen months the Jupiter transit zigzags into Pisces , back to Aquarius , to Pisces into Aries , and back into Pisces Let us reflect on what Jupiter in Pisces means for you and the world .\nLike a cosmic Santa Claus , Jupiter has girth and represents qualities of gregarious generosity .\nNo other archetypal figure is known for its laugh , like Santa Claus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jupiter is ` Zeus \u2019 ; the king of the gods , larger than life , the ruler of the universe .\nJupiter gifts us with the humor , positivity , and optimism where it transits .\nJupiter \u2019 s meaning is built on the foundation of beliefs , philosophy , and benevolence .\nCritical to Jupiter \u2019 s character is truth , and like a good king , sovereignty .\nWhere you find your natal Jupiter , for example , is where you pursue you find freedom by expressing the truth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far the biggest planet in our solar system .\nJupiter is so large that over thirteen hundred earths could fit into the gas giant .\nTake an astrological cue from Jupiter \u2019 s size ; where it transits it expands .\nOf course , in practical applications big is not always better .\nMany a Jupiter transit has correlated with simply ` expansion \u2019 ; expansion of one \u2019 s waistline , expansion of one \u2019 s individual freedoms post-divorce , or the ultimate expansion of the soul which occurs at death .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ lend itself to largeness\u2014which is not always initially welcomed but ultimately for ` the best.\n\u2019 Since Jupiter is known as the great ` benefic \u2019 a Jupiter transit generally corresponds with a positive and uplifting result eventually .\nJupiter expresses its benevolence swimmingly well as it transits Pisces .\nAs one of the co-rulers of the sign of the Fish , Jupiter resonates with the Pisces traits of understanding through compassion , artistry through imagination , and transcendence through altered states of consciousness .\nPisces rules all things ` beyond reality \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reflections , spirituality , the numinous , symbolism , dreams , divinity , idealism , imagination , illusion .\nEven though ethereal Pisces represents beyond reality , ironically , it also embodies the ` all of life \u2019 .\nPisces is the quintessential water sign , necessary for all life .\nThe planetary ruler of Pisces is king of the seas , Neptune .\nWater is the great dissolver , the primordial mover of matter , and the common substance that connects us all .\nIn this way , Pisces simultaneously embraces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above it all \u2019 , soul , spirit , transcendence .\nJupiter \u2019 s transit through Pisces promises to magnify and enlarge the essence of the watery and mutable energy .\nAny shifts will only be hinted upon in 2021 .\nThat is because the ingress of Jupiter starting on May 13th will scarcely cover the first two degrees of Pisces before Jupiter shifts back into Aquarius on July 28th .\nJupiter won \u2019 t pick up speed until 2022 and , like a wave , crests with its expansive gifts on April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neptune .\nThat is when we collectively experience the blending of the two rulers of Pisces , in its home sign .\nAny Jupiter Neptune conjunction is a big deal ; it is a cycle that unfolds over a thirteen-year period , coloring a certain spiritual ethos because of the dual rulership in Pisces .\nWe are currently living through the waning phase of the Jupiter Neptune conjunction of 2009 which occurred in Aquarius .\nA Jupiter Neptune Cycle in Pisces is even more momentous because of its rarity , and because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe last time we collectively experienced a Jupiter Neptune conjunction in Pisces was in 1856 .\nThe late nineteenth century exploded with spiritual questing ; the transcendental movement , the beginnings of hypnosis , psychotherapy , Theosophy , the religion of Spiritualism , as well as the American Civil War predicated on human freedoms .\nWe might expect a similar explosion in spiritual yearning over the next twelve months .\nWhat might we expect as Jupiter emphasizes the Piscean qualities ?\nLooking backwards to anticipate the future illuminates .\nThe last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was the year when two news stories dominated : the devastating earthquake in Haiti , and the Wiki document dump by Julian Assange .\nThe world \u2019 s heart strings responded to the Haitian citizens with unprecedented compassion , a true Pisces trait .\nJupiter \u2019 s questing for truth correlates with that of the largest release of military documents ever\u2014over 400 \u2013 by independent journalist Assange .\nInterestingly , Julian Assange is now in the news on the eve of this next Jupiter in Pisces ingress , as there are increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9458509/Julian-Assange-supporters-demanding-release-hold-vigils-London-today.html ) Top movies in 2010 reflect the dominate Jupiter in Pisces themes , death , water , dreams and hypnosis .\nThe plot of the ` Hereafter \u2019 involves a psychic who provides solace to people by communicating with their dead loved ones .\nA character in the movie believes she had a near death experience while being trapped in a tsunami .\nThe ` Illusionist \u2019 is a movie about the very Pisces themed hypnotherapist , and the ` Inception \u2019 features a plot involving dream technology to thwart a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Jupiter was again in Pisces ?\nHistory was made when the film the \u2018 Titanic \u2019 gathered the most awards of any film \u2014ever .\n( tied with Ben Hur ) Obviously , the word , titanic , means Jupiterian \u2018 big \u2019 , as the movie depicted the sorrowful Pisces themes of loss and death plus the fantasy of forever romance set upon the watery abyss of Neptune \u2019 s sea .\nMoving forward in 2021 to 2022 , possible expectations include ; \u2022 Evidence of greater spiritual questing through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychic and mediumistic development circles , meditation , and prayer .\n\u2022 A collective need to connect with others through active compassionate giving and support .\n\u2022 A demand for transparency from governments ,

Nature within The New Moon in Fixed Earth on the 11th May 2021 at 18:59 UTC We are not the first to express concerns over the direction of the 1518 redistribution of power .\nYes , the intellectual revolution has brought much material comfort and innovation in every facet of life .\nBut its shadow has meant that further and further away from the Earth we have walked , as Nature has been productised .\nUrbanisation spreads like cancer across the land , suffocating the very land we need to survive .\nMaterialistic rationalisation encourages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a black hole , divorcing us from the life that feed true meaning .\nOur addiction to the world of senses drives humanity to the brink of an environmental and psychological abyss .\nPeriodically we are reminded that Nature cares little for our collective greed , detachedness and narcissism even if those who voice out are deemed Luddites with quaint antiquarian Golden Age concerns .\nBut something is different within this 2020 redistribution of power .\nIt is not simply because of the earth making her voice heard , as the weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner ; or because the massive growth in population demands to be fed in a manner that is unsustainable ; or because the black blood of the earth thins at an alarming rate .\nIt is because we can not avoid the simple fact that both your physical body and our collective body is unwell .\nFor some time your digestive system has not been right .\nMany have been unable to consume poor quality foods or cheap alcohol ; many women are turning away from ingesting horse hormones that dull them from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gluten sensitivity has never been higher ; so too the unwillingness to eat traumatised animals reared in the dark for the sole purpose of slaughter .\nThe rise of awareness of food , nutrition and diet has been phenomenal .\nThe world you live within is one that has taught you that your mind is the only truly important part of your being .\nThinking that your body has a consciousness is New Age claptrap !\nConsequently you have been encouraged to ignore your body by driving it into the ground through excessive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 that money brings .\nYou have been taught to hurt it by telling it is not skinny enough , too wrinkly , too thin , too unattractive , too untoned , too lumpy , too short , too tall , too brown , too blond\u2026 And then you feed it \u2013 too much , too little , listening to experts who know your body better than you do , who teach you to follow a universal system that works for everyone ; feeding it with food incompatible with it , downing poison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the reality that perhaps happiness does not exist where you want it\u2026 Yet your body has been trying to get your attention .\nIt has been talking to you !\nBut do you listen ?\nThat voice in your head that tells you \u2018 not to \u2019 does not come from vanity .\nThat voice that tells you that you have had enough does not come from guilt .\nThat bloated feeling , that queasy feeling , that reflux taste , that \u2018 allergic \u2019 reaction is your body telling you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of poison .\nAll ancient philosophies contend that everything contains consciousness \u2013 every organ of your body and every morsel of \u2018 real \u2019 food that you eat .\nYou are the embodied material form of creation .\nYour body encases your true essence \u2013 your spirit and it is merely a sleeve that you wear .\nAnd your body breaks down when you choose not to listen to the prompts that arise within your mind and emotional body as a last ditch attempt to get you to WAKE UP .\nAs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quakes !\nYour body symbiotically reacts with the matter that arises from the consciousness held within the Earth \u2019 s chemical matrixes .\nShamans remind you that rocks talk ; your stomach screams at you not to poison it\u2026 everything , everything has an animated consciousness .\nThe rampant spread of the artificially created \u2018 19 \u2019 , a symptom of the widespread illness that exists in our world , has reminded many that consciousness is not merely an anthropomorphic entitlement , that everything is teaming with \u2018 mind \u2019 , that underneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animate spirit that bathes and permeates of the world of form .\nAnd it exists because of the presence of the Fixed Earth , or Taurean , archetype .\nTaurus , composed of two energetic conditions \u2013 \u2018 fixed \u2019 meaning internal and Earth , meaning matter \u2013 merely accounts for the fact that your body is alive and teeming with spirit .\nThis archetype reminds you that your soul is anchored within this physical realm of existence , encased within a physical body and subjected to all the aromatic delights that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a freshly brewed morning coffee ; the freshly mowed grass on a cool sun kissed vernal morning ; the crisp ionised air that surrounds a babbling and cascading brook and its fresh coolness that fills your lungs as you stop to breathe in the sounds of the water , as it crashes over the stones and rocks , eagerly chattering its way towards the contrasting quietness of the forest lake ; the dense scent of vanilla-musk body spray that makes you feel dizzy as you linger in that first close embrace with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your memory that you are to enjoy being in the world , but not being consumed by the world !\n!\nWhile physical-desire may be but one dimension of the Taurean archetype , so too is the need to learn the deeper spiritual lessons of desire wherein you can transform the energy of desire into spiritual aspiration , as encapsulated within that exemplary Taurean philosophy \u2013 Buddha \u2019 s Four Noble Truths .\nIt is through your desire-nature that you are kept fastened to the Earth Plane on a perpetual cycle of death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of most spiritual disciplines is the transmutation of desire into spiritual realisation by coming to terms with any unhealthy desire attachments which essentially keep you bound within your ego-mind and need to be eventually overcome .\nIt is within Taurus that your desires and your most materialistic impulses can be transmuted into aspiration through the light of illumination .\nThe Inner Light of Nature Planets that you have within the sign of Taurus can teach you what specific dimension of your Soul is here to learn about the nature of desire .\nIf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within Taurus , then look to the house that Taurus is either on the cusp of , or intercepted by , to understand the arena of life wherein your desire-nature will be played out .\nThe path of Taurus necessarily involves a strong will and strong choices , for desire has the habit of leading your attention outwards towards worldly concerns .\nThose Taurean planets are custodians of the light of knowledge , enabling you to tap beyond the seduction of the world of form , releasing all attachments and security desires , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you open the eye of the cosmic Bull , bathing in the light that cascades like devotional tears from it , cleansing and purifying your soul .\nConsequently , as you listen to those Taurean scripts , you can hear specific animistic voices speak to you , as each planetary archetype has its own language and perception , reminding you that matter speaks , matter lives , matter matters .\nThe Gift of the Fixed Earth New Moon We have been moving through the illumination of this quiet Light of Nature since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taurus on the 19th of April .\nHowever , the day that the Luminaries meet within Taurus is a call to renew your relationship to the spirit that exists within your body .\nIn the days leading up to the New Moon , you are called to remember the importance of your relationship to your body , your food , your environment and Nature as a whole .\nFurther to the releasing and shedding that has prevailed , as symbolised by our reactions to the spread of a virus , you are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the consciousness held within your body , your food and your environment .\nA New Earth is in the midst of being birthed and this forthcoming Taurean lunation serves beautifully for an initiation of intentions regarding your relationship to truly listening to what your body is telling you , not what your mind tells you about your body ; to talk to the food that you are eating , thanking it for what it will do for you ; to listen to what nature is telling you and being conscious of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extension of your own body , keeping in mind that your body comes from the Earth and is inexorably linked to it .\nI wish you a profound , gentle , conscious and compassionate relationship to your body , your food , your Nature and your World .", "author": "Andrew Smith",

next eighteen months the Jupiter transit zigzags into Pisces , back to Aquarius , to Pisces into Aries , and back into Pisces Let us reflect on what Jupiter in Pisces means for you and the world .\nLike a cosmic Santa Claus , Jupiter has girth and represents qualities of gregarious generosity .\nNo other archetypal figure is known for its laugh , like Santa Claus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jupiter is ` Zeus \u2019 ; the king of the gods , larger than life , the ruler of the universe .\nJupiter gifts us with the humor , positivity , and optimism where it transits .\nJupiter \u2019 s meaning is built

is where you pursue you find freedom by expressing the truth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far the biggest planet in our solar system .\nJupiter is so large that over thirteen hundred earths could fit into the gas giant .\nTake an astrological cue from Jupiter \u2019 s size ; where it transits it expands .\nOf course , in practical applications big is not always better .\nMany a Jupiter transit has correlated with simply ` expansion \u2019 ; expansion of one \u2019 s waistline , expansion of one \u2019 s individual freedoms post-divorce , or the ultimate expansion of the soul which occurs at death .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ lend itself to largeness\u2014which is not always initially welcomed but ultimately for ` the best.\n\u2019 Since Jupiter is known as the great ` benefic \u2019 a Jupiter transit generally corresponds with a positive and uplifting result eventually .\nJupiter expresses its benevolence swimmingly well as it transits Pisces .\nAs one of the co-rulers of the sign of the Fish , Jupiter resonates with the Pisces traits of understanding through compassion , artistry through imagination , and transcendence through altered states of consciousness .\nPisces rules all things ` beyond reality \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reflections , spirituality , the numinous , symbolism , dreams , divinity , idealism , imagination , illusion .\nEven though ethereal Pisces represents beyond reality , ironically , it also embodies the ` all of life \u2019 .\nPisces is the quintessential water sign , necessary for all life .\nThe planetary ruler of Pisces is king of the seas , Neptune .\nWater is the great dissolver , the primordial mover of matter , and the common substance that connects us all .\nIn this way , Pisces simultaneously embraces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above it all \u2019 , soul , spirit , transcendence .\nJupiter \u2019 s transit through Pisces promises to magnify and enlarge the essence of the watery and mutable energy .\nAny shifts will only be hinted upon in 2021 .\nThat is because the ingress of Jupiter starting on May 13th will scarcely cover the first two degrees of Pisces before Jupiter shifts back into Aquarius on July 28th .\nJupiter won \u2019 t pick up speed until 2022 and , like a wave , crests with its expansive gifts on April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neptune .\nThat is when we collectively experience the blending of the two rulers of Pisces , in its home sign .\nAny Jupiter Neptune conjunction is a big deal ; it is a cycle that unfolds over a thirteen-year period , coloring a certain spiritual ethos because of the dual rulership in Pisces .\nWe are currently living through the waning phase of the Jupiter Neptune conjunction of 2009 which occurred in Aquarius .\nA Jupiter Neptune Cycle in Pisces is even more momentous because of its rarity , and because of @ @ @

2020-7th Mar 2023", "content": "Saturn will be entering into Aquarius in March 2020 , retrograde back to Capricorn on 2 July and move back to Aquarius on 17 December , a few days before a new Jupiter-Saturn cycle is formed .\nSaturn will dip back and forth between the signs that represent the old and the new , creating a reflection on what we need to leave behind and what will be kept when we journey toward new potential .\nWe are up for changes .\n2020 promises some real game-changers .\nA new Pluto-Saturn cycle begins , Saturn moves into Aquarius , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go retrograde in Aries and there is a new Saturn-Jupiter cycle to finish the year .\nThat is quite a bit .\nLife is synonymous with change and deep inside of us lives simultaneously a deep fear and a deep yearning , for it \u2019 s bound to cause both stress and anticipation .\n2020 is no exception .\nRarely do we see such a stack up of planetary events .\nWe all have a little fear about the current state of affairs , but keep in mind that the perfect storms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision and changes .\nEvery time Saturn shifts signs , I feel slightly elated and excited .\nWhile I am not quite sure what it is that is tickling my curiosity , it could be the memory of an article I read long ago about how the Dawn of the Internet would change the coming cycles in ways that made it hard to predict how any astrological cycles would manifest .\nAnd my natural question would then be : \u2018 So how will astrologers be surprised as we now face the first transit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Internet ?\n\u2019 The presence of the Internet provides both an upgrade of awareness that runs at high speed and a massive explosion of time-consuming nonsense .\nThere is a certain information overload and people are struggling to find out what is real and what is not .\nThe rhythm of our lives has changed , developments come at a much more rapid pace than our biology is prepared for and most people are unable to keep track .\nThe benefit is a potential awakening in people .\nIf we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now have the potential to see what we are projecting and our motivations .\nWe will see if our actions are a part of the problem or a part of the solution .\nThrough the medium of the Internet we get to see what is going on in the big brain of the world , and it isn \u2019 t always beautiful .\nPatti Smith once said about the Internet that it is still in its adolescence , but it carries the potential for global revolution , and we see how this potent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us both into darkness and light .\nGlobalization took a big step forward with the Age of the Internet , an age that heralds the Age of Aquarius itself .\nLast round of Saturn in Aquarius : The Gulf War and operation Desert Storm in 1991 set into motion a situation that the world is still dealing with , and this particular war on the Iraqis signified a change .\nIt heralded a new era in warfare with laserguided bomb and advanced surveillance technology .\nMajor General Paul Johnson said about it : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Desert Storm of what would become the transformation of air power.\n\u2019 By the end of 1991 the former USSR was also history , and on 25 December the Russian flag got raised over the Kremlin with Saturn at 5 degrees Aquarius , leading directly to the independence of several new republics .\nAlso Yugoslavia split into Slovenia , Serbia , Croatia , Kosova and Bosnia and Herzegovina .\nEritrea seceded from the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia , Africa .\nThe maps of Europe were changed drastically with new countries popping up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Contest became a very long evening in front of the television .\nIn Western Europe the Maastricht Treaty was set into effect in 1993 and thus created the foundation rock of the European Union .\nThe televised war from Iraq also led us into understanding the impact of world events on our individual consciousness , and we saw that the world was moving quickly toward a more Aquarian way of life ; one where we are interconnected and capable of influencing and being influenced .\nThe cell phone was something \u2018 everybody \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be created in 1992 as the invention of new technology catapulted the world into new opportunities to connect .\nThe first website was created at CERN and launched in August 1991 .\nThe massive pull towards further globalization can be explained by the long conjunction of Neptune and Uranus in Capricorn and later in Aquarius .\nHowever , the years 1991-1994 were particularly interesting as Saturn moved through Aquarius changing the political structures of particularly Europe , but also of Japan , China , India and most large nations around the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after , we are living in a world where information seems to be the foundation of our world .\nCommunication with friends , surfing the Internet , connecting on Facebook , the creation of videos , podcasts and blogs has taken over a lot of our everyday life .\nJust imagine , in 1991 , none of us knew what was coming .\nWe still hadn \u2019 t read a blog and not many of us had texted our friends on a phone .\nNow we can stalk , research , cheat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web .\nWe can gain and use or gain and abuse information at a large scale .\nIn 2013 Edward Snowden released the NSA files and it showed us that surveillance is more massive than we might have fooled ourselves to believe .\nThe right to privacy is stated under Article 12 \u2018 No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy , family , home or correspondence , nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation.\n\u2019 However , we seem to give up this right in the realm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post and share is one thing , but it is quite different when we realize that our privacy is compromised through phones picking up on conversations and our private messages being available material for those who sit behind the wheels .\nWhen we share in Messenger , we evidently have signed up to having our private sphere shared .\nI am certain I am not the only one who has felt slightly shocked after realizing that I get advertisements on my phone for something that I have talked about in a private conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nwe can look at the chart for Facebook and the solar chart for Mark Zuckerberg and ponder what will happen when Saturn hits those middle degrees of Aquarius in 2021 .\nHe has already been under scrutiny for not being entirely clean in his business , and with Saturn being Saturn ; it is hard to imagine that there won \u2019 t be any consequences for his particular style of running things .\nBut that is just children \u2019 s food compared to the surveillance that goes on behind our backs .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ theme that we continuously debate and are called to protect , but the real question remains : Are we moving toward more liberty or less ?\nThe George Orwell futuristic and dystopian book 1984 was published in June 1949 and has since become a household name , a concept and a symbol for our current situation .\nGeorge Orwell himself was born with Saturn in Aquarius , and his work culminated in the book that is now historical .\nHis own life was a constant search for truth and the adjective Orwellian is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , secret surveillance , brazenly misleading terminology , and manipulation of recorded history by a totalitarian or authoritarian state \u2019 [ 1 ] .\nThe storyline in the book is set to a post-war scenario in the fictitious land of Oceania , where people are constantly watched and kept under control .\nBig Brother is keeping firm control and protagonist Winston Smith is a rebellious , low-class citizen challenging Big Brother \u2019 s authority .\nThe plot is more than familiar\u2014dictatorial control compromising human rights and dignity .\nIt is interesting to note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded in 1949 , and after Mao , China started monitoring citizens , keeping them under tight control .\nThe Social Credit System established in 2014 is a system wherein a person gets social conduct registered and receives a score , and from 2020 this will be mandatory for all Chinese .\nIt is also interesting to note that censorship in China became even more severe after the demonstrations of Tiananmen Square in 1989 when Saturn was in Capricorn conjunct Uranus and Neptune .\nChina is censoring the Internet and access to social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have the highest density of government surveillance cameras installed in public in the world and use several domination techniques to keep the rule .\nThey are becoming the kind of state that Orwell envisioned .\nChina is not the only one though .\nMost countries in the West are using technology to monitor their citizens and it is little wonder that this book has seen its renaissance .\nGeorge Orwell would have been slightly surprised to see how right he would be about his vision for the future .\nThere is little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations arise in terms of privacy and the future of the Internet as Saturn , and later Pluto , transit Aquarius .\nAfter another complete Saturn-Pluto cycle and Saturn \u2019 s move to Aquarius followed by Pluto to Aquarius , we can without doubt say that the greatest obstacle and challenge for the future is the threat of censorship and the surveillance of the people that has been surfacing for a while .\nThe economical and political matrixes of the world are moving more and more towards full control over people , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is even tempting to think that since this cycle happens in the aftermath of Saturn-Pluto new cycle ( 12 January , 2020 ) the social and political discussion on earth will be concentrated around Human Rights , the distribution of wealth , social injustice and technological advances challenging and changing the life of each individual .\nUranus , the ruling principle of Aquarius , is now in Taurus , symbolizing Earth herself , and with Saturn going through Aquarius , representing science ; we might see changes in how we feed the planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find solutions to the growing problem of the size of the human family .\nAs per November 2019 , earth hosts 7.7 billion human lives , with 10 percent living in extreme poverty .\nThe numbers are on the decline and in 1990 a staggering 34 percent lived in extreme poverty .\nSo in certain ways things are moving forward .\nHow to feed the planet and maintain a healthy earth are a couple of the absolutely vital issues we will deal with during the new cycle of Saturn-Pluto lasting until 2053 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conjunction in Pisces .\nPoverty gives rise to so many social problems and since Aquarius deals with groups it is likely that we might expect simultaneous reforms and protests .\nHow earth then will look in the future is hard to perceive , but with each planetary transit through Aquarius we get a further chance to understand how different groups and races must learn to work together as a whole family .\nMaybe we will see new visions for modern housing being set in motion or plans being presented on how to employ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve are still in the midst of is over .\nIn 2004 co-founder of the famous festival Burning Man wrote some ideas and principles that are known as the Ten Principles of Burning Man .\nThey are as follows : For me they stand as the foundation rock upon which the ideals of Aquarius rest .\nIf we are to thrive as a species , the higher side of Aquarius needs to be understood and our childish egos , the shadow side of Leo , will have to be put aside .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both Aquarius and its opposing sign , Leo that the transit of Saturn through Aquarius might reveal .\n\u2022 Aquarius is a sign that rules groups , societies , friendships and science .\nIt covers higher knowledge , detachment and visions of the future .\nThe downside is coldness and cynicism , isolation and disassociation , sarcasm and criticism .\nAquarius is all about consciousness , a higher awareness about the state of affairs , and through Aquarius and its modern ruler , Uranus , we get a chance to see how we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bad .\nEvery sign has a shadow and with the dawn of technology we saw that humanity is capable of killing others while sitting safely tucked behind the remote controls .\nThere is a coldness and a cynicism to Aquarius that happens when anyone gets too detached from their heart and emotion .\nWe can all be a little heady from time to time , but the Aquarius loftiness is bordering on dissociation .\nAn individual born with Saturn in Aquarius might have to deal with the consequences of having been let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from family or friends or struggling with a deep outsider syndrome .\nThey may have such a keen intelligence that they get stuck in analysis of the weakness of human nature and life in general , in turn sending the individual into a depression and a feeling of never being able to set firm roots in life .\nThis rootlessness is a challenge and self-criticism is on an all-time high .\nSaturn can be melancholic and dismayed here , and nihilism and dystopia are very often the result .\nSome of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeff Boss , was born with Neptune in Scorpio square Saturn in Aquarius .\nThere is a whole sub-generation born from 1991 to 1993 who has Uranus-Neptune in Capricorn , Pluto in Scorpio and Saturn in Aquarius and who are now facing their first Saturn return .\nA quick survey among them reveals that a lot of them feel betrayed by society and let down by the elders .\nThey often come with a much higher intelligence than their parents , having been born with access to information their parents never had .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry and the hubris in Aquarius is the famous \u2018 know-it-all \u2019 attitude that translates to fixity of the mind and a rigidity of the bones .\nIt can be cold , isolated and lonely , lacking spontaneity and capacity to trust the heart .\nWhen all illusions are gone , what is then left ?\nNeurology is associated with Aquarius and certain eccentricities and fetishes come under its domain .\nIt will become evident , as Saturn moves through Aquarius , just how the porn industry has affected human sexuality and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extreme stimulation .\nThis comes as a direct consequence of the overuse of porn to stimulate the sexual parts of our brains .\nSaturn seeks to correct all that is misaligned , and when we get too detached we need to reconnect with our heart .\nIssues pertaining to intimacy versus freedom will become more important for us all to work on as we seek to find a better balance between detachment and attachment .\nAquarius also correlates to Buddhism with its strong correspondence to the science and method behind enlightenment .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practices centred on being mindful , Buddhism is in perfect synch with the Aquarian mind .\nThis is a path that teaches among other things , the power of detachment .\nHowever , if detachment is taken too far , without the integration of another important Buddhist principle , compassion ; we are on the verge of creating psychopathy , a condition renowned for its absence of empathy .\nTo be mindful and objective , detached and aware of the nature of projection is the key to world peace .\nGiven the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may experience a situation , with Saturn in Aquarius , where we find ourselves needing to address the development of a situation of spiritual bypass .\nThrough Aquarius Saturn can teach us , in a good way , to transcend the mind and avoid the traps of falling into personal desires and the ensuing suffering .\nHowever that is a journey we can not fake or pretend to master .\nWithout the connection to our heart and to our human nature , we will witness a rise in cynicism At its best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of our social responsibilities and ensure that we move into the world presenting our highest levels of awareness , while not letting our unconscious selves be projected without question .\nSince Aquarius has to do with science , controversy about robotics , AI , house robots like Alexa and other new inventions could emerge .\nWith our world being taken over more and more by electronic gadgets and virtual reality , we might start questioning the real consequences of this evolution .\nSaturn is always about understanding the consequences of anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are losing our humanness in this maze of electronics .\n, Elon Musk \u2019 s new invention , attempts to sync human brains with a computer and trials of this on humans will begin in 2020 .\nMusk himself is born with his North Node and Mars in Aquarius , and it is hard to imagine that his work will not face some serious setback , adjustments or other ethical challenges as Saturn proceeds relentlessly through Aquarius .\nMusk said about his project that it can help cure some people with neurological disabilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity as a civilization , relative to AI .\nThe goal is to achieve a symbiosis with artificial intelligence .\nNow , despite the rather gloomy downsides to this , in terms of political control over people , Musk \u2019 s vision seems to be on the side of evolutionary thinking .\nSooner or later this symbiosis will happen , but it is not without ethical aspects deeply embedded in it .\nWhat are the consequences of such a symbiosis ?\nIs technology making us into better human beings or worse ?\nWhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this kind of technology falls into the wrong hands , the consequences are gloomy .\nTherefore , we also need to take a look into the opposite sign , Leo , to understand the full context of Saturn in Aquarius .\nAs with all principles of life any sign is reflected in its opposite expression .\nThe one can not live without the other .\nLeo and Aquarius are the opposite sides of creative expression moving into the world : participation and creation .\nIn order for the Aquarian ideals of brother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to emerge humanity still has to deal with narcissism and selfishness , the dark side of the archetype Leo .\nLeo will get a certain attention whilst Saturn transits Aquarius , but not perhaps as Leo likes .\nNot all feedback is good feedback ; it depends on the intention of creation .\nSaturn with its no-bullshit attitude will certainly peek rather critically at the Leonian aptitude for selfish creation .\nAnd that is not necessarily a bad sign as it heralds an awakening of compassion for others , reminding the Leo impulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the self .\nBut as long as the proverbial Child Archetype that is Leo is not yet ready to be a student , then the teachings will be direct , clear and without sympathy .\nWe all have to learn to think not only of ourselves , but also of others .\nI would like to add a little disclaimer here to not insult the many beautiful Leos who read this .\nWhen I say Leonian archetype , I refer to a state of mind that is that inner and not conscious child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impulse in Aquarius can not be expressed until we overcome our own sense of separation and self-inflation .\nIt will be evident , as Saturn crosses the plains of Aquarius , that dictatorial and childish ways of ruling people will be challenged .\nWith Saturn in Aquarius there can be issues with friendships and group dynamic that will prompt us to look at our own creative capacities and learn about the true art of giving without becoming either too obsessed with our own sense of importance or too dimmed by the somewhat cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents the audience and whatever we give will be received .\nHow it is received can either stifle our expression ( Leo ) or ignite growth , because we are capable of taking instructions and receiving feedback .\nAs the year 2020 ends with a new cycle of Jupiter-Saturn in Aquarius , the journey of maturation that happened whilst they both were in Capricorn can result in the emergence of a personality that is ready to move into the world with full power .\nEveryone is keeping their eyes on the election in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a new \u2019 King \u2019 ?\nOr maybe even a \u2018 Queen \u2019 ?\nSaturn-Jupiter is an aspect renowned for its leadership capacity and as this new conjunction happens in Aquarius , it is easy to get a little excited and anticipate that the world will see something entirely new emerge from this upcoming election .\nBeing the world \u2019 s only official superpower , the US holds not only an interesting position in world politics , but also in the collective unconscious .\nWhatever happens in the US holds great symbolic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nPolitics is always a hot potato and right now the current climate is ripe with anger and frustration .\nIt makes no sense discussing politics during such a time ; however with Saturn in Aquarius moves toward a more socially just system might be prevalent for this upcoming election .\nBoth leading candidates for the Democrats , Sanders and Warren , are showing strong leanings towards socialism .\nIn the future we all have to learn to share , and the skewed system that is now so evident , with the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , will face some resistance as Saturn moves through Capricorn .\nSocialism might become popular even in the States .\n\u201c After another complete Saturn-Pluto cycle and Saturn \u2019 s move to Aquarius followed by Pluto , we can without doubt say that the greatest obstacle and challenge for the future is the threat of censorship and the surveillance of the people that has been surfacing for a while .\nThe economical and political matrixes of the world are moving more and more towards full control over people , as technology is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the new cycle of Saturn-Pluto begins in Capricorn , a sign that speaks volumes about integrity and true authority .\nAs Saturn will move back to Capricorn in July , the steps we \u2019 ve taken toward the future will be tested as a consequence .\nWe might all have to think one more time about the conditioning of the past , what to keep and what to move away from .\nThere is realism in both signs ; however with Aquarius we get a chance to take some quantum steps towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Pluto are the big players .\nThe Boomers , a generation that has run the world , will be replaced by younger leaders .\nPerhaps that will be the result of the coming election .\nA new fresh Prince or Princess of the Future will step up on the throne and rule , taking into account that we are not here to rule the world , but to make sure that our children can inherent a treasure .\nThat treasure is life itself .\nThen again , that could be only me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without a dream of a better future what are any of us left with ?\nNow is the time to create some solid vision both individually and collectively .\nUse your mind to its highest purpose .\nAnother point of interest is that a lot of the big nations on earth show up with planets in mid-degrees Leo-Aquarius .\nIt is thus to be anticipated that as Saturn progresses through these mid-degrees from 2021 we might except social and political changes manifesting as social unrest and a rise to revolution or change .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 1st of Nov 1993 , ( 00.01 am ) Brussels , Belgium \u2013 Maastricht treaty came into effect 1 November 1993

"content": "\u201c The mind is like a parachute : it doesn \u2019 t work if it isn \u2019 t open \u201d A favourite airy quote for the curious and versatile , free-thinking and usually fast-wheeling Gemini , the zodiac sign of the Twins , through which the Sun now traverses , suggests maintaining an open mind , and having someone to talk to , is essential to have any perspective of time and space \u2013 particularly now during the Full Super Moon Total Lunar Eclipse , aka a \u2018 Flower SuperMoon \u2019 in the Northern Hemisphere , and \u2018 Blood Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asia , Australasia , Northern to mid-west America and Canada , plus the southern tip of South America .\nThis fantastically named \u201c Flower Blood Super Moon Total Lunar Eclipse \u201d begins totality at 11:11UT and ends at 11:25UT .\nAnd while that might seem a fast culmination , the whole eclipse begins at 8:45UT and lasts a leisurely five hours .\nCheck your time zones to tune into a magic number that opens a magic portal\u2026 Before we cross the heavenly guarded entrance and go through this rather amazing stargate , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witty and light-hearted Gemini Sun is in the home sign of its \u2019 quick-thinking planetary counterpart , the heavenly messenger , Mercury .\nNote also how Mercury is in his own domain in Gemini and slowing down right now ( to go retrograde from 30th May \u2013 22nd June \u2013 SOLstice ! )\n, making the next few weeks an excellent time to look back , revise , and rethink certain courses of action \u2013 with an open mind .\nCheck where the mutable and multitalented 5\u00b0-11\u00b0Gemini Sun and Sagittarius Moon align in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most receptive to the kind of change that goes easily with the flow \u2013 and can still hit a bullseye !\n\u2606 A thrice-yearly Mercury Retrograde is always time to re-jig , re-focus , and review , which often means facts and figures , contracts , and anything specifically concerning buying and selling , health , news , and any associated information , will require double-checking with extra patience .\nArtful Mercury is also with loving Venus AND the destiny-fulfilling Ascending Lunar Node : thoughts of peace , connecting with friends , loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socialising can pacify any anxiety and nervousness to generate the beginnings of a deep and calm recovery through what is essentially a time of historical collective confusion and trauma .\nDuring such moments , the trick is to stay informed but not get sucked into past obsessions or future pipedreams , whatever they may be .\nThe freedom to understand the true nature of reality beckons , all-the-while the astral advice is to remain open-hearted and friendly towards everyone we meet .\n\u2606 Looking at the night sky from a broader spiritual perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential to activate immense female \u2018 Shakti Power \u2019 with a powerful female ascension due to an impressive \u2018 Royal Star \u2019 alignment with an Esoteric \u2018 Mutable Cross \u2019 that stimulates a deeply feminine aspect of our innate human psyche called \u2018 Love-Wisdom \u2019 ( Yes , guys have it too . )\n, which awakens our \u2018 higher \u2019 mind \u2019 * .\nAs these Fixed Royal Stars shine with \u2018 The Lights \u2019 , Sun and Moon , they will also include the eclipsing nodal axis , in a tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pantheons \u2019 Sacred Guru , the wise and magnanimous teacher , and asteroid Vesta , youthful Goddess of the Hearth and home , so symbolic of growing one \u2019 s inner-light .\nThis , therefore , is a mighty strong Full Moon Lunar Eclipse ( and last supermoon of the year ) with a very rare kind of \u2018 T-Square \u2019 , primarily because all three planets ( Sun & Moon , Jupiter ) are closely conjunct highly influential \u2018 Fixed Royal Stars \u2019 that are also known as \u2018 Watcher Stars \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 .\nThe fourth \u2018 Watcher Star \u2019 constellated Luna as she waxed towards the honourable Virgo Vesta a week before the Full Moon , igniting the heart-fire within this eclipse .\nA long-held understanding of the Majesty of the four stars comes from ancient Persia \u2019 s priestly stargazers .\nAnd just as this eclipse spotlights our human dualistic nature and therefore the shadow within , which is the very same part of ourselves we often disown , transfer and/or project , can now be seriously encouraged to step into the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 are universal heavenly guides , like Archangels that guard the mysteries of heart and mind , spirit and soul .\nAll four \u2018 Watchers \u2019 also come with a major quest , where the challenge to keep one \u2019 s moral integrity scrupulously intact under any circumstance ( no matter how tempting a slick Gemini style superficial short-cut get-rich-quick scheme , or the slippery silver-tongue of a lying , cheating second-hand car-dealer ) .\nRoyal Stars dictate success only really comes when we rise to high ideals and remain honest and ethical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindness , and one \u2019 s heartmind fixed firmly upon the good of all .\nFrom this astrologer \u2019 s point of view , it is remarkable to note how the four guardians of heavenly stargates quite wonderfully now reveal the way into a celestial mandala \u2013 a magic circle \u2013 with both Lights ( Sun & Moon ) and Sacred Guru Jupiter to make this a compelling Full Super Moon .\nAs all four \u2018 watchers \u2019 energize this deeply illuminating lunation that culminates in the Full Flower Blood Super Moon Lunar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth ) life , enlightenment and mahaparanirvana of the historical Sakyamuni Gotama Buddha ) .\nLighting up our stargate portal at the waxing First Quarter Moon , May 19th , Luna conjoined asteroid Goddess Vesta to ignite a spark of courage with noble Heart-Star , \u2018 Regulus \u2019 , the \u2018 Watcher in the North \u2019 reminding us how success is never possible if one acts with vengeance .\nAlso during this intensely fascinating Lunar Eclipse , the Heart-Star radiates towards the generous wisdom teacher , ethical Jupiter , which closely conjuncts another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nourishing \u2018 Watcher in the South \u2019 .\nAnd because expansive Jupiter is the ruler of the Full Sagittarius Moon , also now in his traditional home of the all-encompassing , oceanic Pisces , Jupiter wields a vastly magnetic and inspirational , almost hypnotic potency over this Full Super Moon .\nIn other words , Jupiter \u2019 s magnanimous blessings abound ( at least until Solstice June 21st , and possibly up to the end of July for those who resonate with early degrees Pisces ) .\nPlus , with the aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now in T-Square to the Sun and North Node , and the Moon and South Node , it affords a clearer overview that indicates our quest is one of positive karma ripening and accomplishing spiritual growth goes extremely well when we keep lofty standards in place and our conduct imperative and pure ; yet still show forgiveness if and or when baser human instinct overcomes honesty and decency .\nJupiter \u2019 s magnanimous influence also bestows confidence , with high hopes that a fragile ego can easily inflate ; so , we also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointment .\nBut supporting this truth-seeking , consciousness-raising Sagittarius Full Super Moon Lunar Eclipse is our emotional connection to our past ( life karma ) .\nBeing honest about feelings , past slights , or perceived sensitivity ( especially within familial relationship ) is not always easy : to get to the heart of unvarnished truth we often wade through all kinds of emotional buffer zones that have their own triggers and dangerous distraction .\nYet now is the time to release past ( life ) obsessions , fixations and negative thought patterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Tail , aka Ketu , the karmic South Node ; at the same time accenting helpful traits and associates brought forward into present conditions \u2013 all this with the help of an intense concentration of Fixed Royal Stars .\nWondrously , the South Node now conjoins \u2018 Antares \u2019 , \u201c Watcher in the West \u201d .\nThus , scarlet star Antares , the Full Super Moon , AND the karmic South Node also face Sol and the North Node , aka the \u2018 Dragon \u2019 s Head \u2019 or Rahu , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 Watcher in the East \u2019 , Fixed Royal Star \u2018 Aldaberan \u2019 , another bright red star that encourages focus with intent , and to empower oneself and others valiantly and consciously , with courage , care and insight .\nAs with all portentous Fixed Royal Star , should we choose to deny the challenge of this evolutionary moment then one would spectacularly fail .\nBare in mind that if ventures don \u2019 t work out the way we planned , at least there will be a valuable learning experience .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , is yours .\nThis Full Moon Lunar Eclipse is the Metal Ox Moon moment when all four heavenly guardians illuminate the direction to take towards our own propensity for enlightenment .\nBe aware that many new and novel possibilities are being presented , with more on the way with the New Moon Solar Eclipse June 10th , on route to Solstice \u2013 another natural turning point when Mercury goes direct , and Jupiter stations retrograde for a longer reflection upon our collective future just as communicating ideas gets the green-light to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly onwards , into the centre of the sacred celestial mandala keeping the metaphorical parachute-mind open , with Love & Light * If practicing any breathwork , meditation , yoga , especially Kundalini Yoga , please do so under guidance and supervision .\n\u201c When you realize that all that appears and exists to be your mind , there is no path of enlightenment apart from that .\n\u201d", "author": "Agent12 Julija", "url": "https://cosmicintelligenceagency.com/supermooneclipsesagittarius/", "published": "Mon, 24 May 2021

the voices of the forest waft along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pausing , he listens .\nThe trill and warbling of the birds carries over the swaying of the branches and the hum of the bees , inebriated with the nectar of the heathers .\nAt one with sound , his mind no longer attached to the endless stream of inner chatter , wanders up and beyond .\nSenses sharpened and body enlivened , he hears the distant crack of a fallen branch and the gentle thud of footfall .\nNo longer alone , he feels the Presence long before he sees it .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ calmness personified , its back legs stamping playfully .\nHe could feel its purity , an untouched loving quality , as its soft black eyes made contact .\nCuriosity prevails as the fawn inches forward .\nSuddenly the fawn \u2019 s head jerks to the left , as from no-where appears a doe .\nFierce eyes flaming , timidity and gentleness disregarded , the doe confidently advances towards him , singular in her intention to protect whatever the cost .\nLittle Spirit starts to hear his breath sharpen and deepen .\nA wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as prepares himself for flight .\nSensing this change in atmosphere , the doe utters a drawn out \u2018 woosh \u2019 and stands her ground between Little Spirit and the fawn .\nAdvancing purposefully , the doe starts to gather speed .\nShaken from his bliss , aware that forest surroundings have shifted , Little Spirit can hear a new sound , that of a clock , beating like his heart in the distance .\nHe can hear the far off sounds of the city , the drone of a car engine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm .\nStruggling to return his gaze to the forest , the landscape bleeds and morphs , as trees give way to walls , as his eye closes and his eyes open .\nMeditation over , the world of the everyday sharpens as the image of the doe and her fawn diminishes , Little Spirit feels a tinge of disappointment that fear got the better of him , rendering him impotent to allow the doe to run through him , or at very least to have softened and allowed love to emanate more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the doe could have sensed that he was not a threat .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve much work to do \u201d , Little Spirit reflected to his Ma-ster .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve not yet reached a state of grace and calmness , especially when confronted .\nMy go-to emotion is that of fear .\nIt is something I need to look at.\n\u201d \u201c Little one , do not fret .\nThe doe was merely protecting pure lOve .\nIt is what the feminine does best .\nIt is wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and courage .\nIt stands firm to protect who and what it loves and believes in .\nBut the feminine responds strongly when it senses that who or what she loves is under threat .\nSo I would ask you to reflect on what is it in you that was frightened or vulnerable in the face of pure innocence ?\n\u201d \u201c The fawn , Little Spirit , is a symbol of innocence and peace .\nIt is a reminder that no matter how winding or thick the path appears to get , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the way for you to remember .\nThe youth of the deer , its curiosity and willingness to approach , speaks of the need to tread your paths with fearlessness and innocence .\nRemember , Little One , that at the level the deeper heart you are a pure and playful being .\nYou reflect the innocence of the Divine .\nThe totem of the fawn is one that can be held in your archetypal identity to remind you to soften to others , open yourself and be vulnerable in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c But what of the doe , Ma-Ster ?\n\u201d , ask Little Spirit \u201c The appearance of the doe suggests that the Universe wants you to stop what you are doing and just to surrender to the moment .\nTo stop the busyness , the over thinking and the anxiety created by being in two places at once .\nHer presence is a reminder that you need to stop and listen to your intuition .\nShe is also a reminder that whilst the feminine is gentle and the protective , she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both innocence and love.\n\u201d \u201c Does that mean that I am not trusting myself and the messages that I am receiving from within ?\n\u201d \u201c Possibly , Little One .\nBut only you can truly know that .\nA fawn may at times approach danger , like a hunter .\nYet its innocence compels it forward in the chance that it may soften a confused heart .\nRemember that you are at times \u201c a fawn on the path \u201d , innocent , pure , and gentle at the core of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget your true nature when the complexity and excitement of life distracts .\nThe winding roads of your paths can and will always take you back to peace and love if you let it.\n\u201d \u201c Thank you Ma-Ster .\nI will reflect more on this meditation \u201d .\nThis has been a time of great change , which is ultimately sure to be positive , life renewing and spiritually uplifting , but fraught with its own challenges , emotional and psychological adjustments , and trials of acceptance and surrender .\nLittle Spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deer serves as a reminder to call upon the principles of unconditional love , patience , innocence and grace .\nYou are being reminded to be gentle with yourself and others , to embrace the organic graceful flow of life , and to love others with an open heart and clear mind .\nYou are also being called to stand up for what you need to protect , to engage the Yin Warrior within you , as the New Moon in Gemini , falls in close alignment with the Amazon Star , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder of the Hunter constellation , Orion .\nThe sign of Gemini speaks of the need to listen to both the voices of logic and intuition , allowing neither to dominate the other , as well as to take the time to speak forth as well as listen to those within your world .\nThe existence of Gemini , or Mutable Air , reminds us of the importance of what we speak of , returns to us .\nTherefore the world you live in is merely a reflection of what you have envisioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call for Little Spirit to realise that fear was his go-to reality when faced with a surprise .\nIt is his path to find what he has gained from developing a relationship with fear and to try to return to a state of grace and innocence .\nThe presence of the dear is merely a reminder that innocence will always be protected by the feminine , as the Yin warrior is not a man \u2019 s projection of the fighter woman , as the Marvel superhero ladies have been depicted .\nBut the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to describe someone who defends core \u2018 feminine \u2019 values , regardless of gender .\nStanding up in defence of children \u2019 s rights ; leading humanitarian efforts ; participating on peace missions ; or stand as a protector of the environment , the consciousness through which Bellatrix draws forth , stands her ground and pushing for change in the face of adversity , injustice or inequality .\nThe New Moon in June is an annular ( or partial ) eclipse , seen from Easter North American , Northern Europe and Northern Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebirth of the Mind-Light ( Retrograde Mercury in conjunction with the Sun , the topic of my most recent webinar ) .\nTherefore not a normal New Moon , the opportunity to open up to the fawn \u2019 s innocence can open new doors to yourself and your relationships that will accelerate your spiritual and emotional evolution .\nBe not wary of the path for it always , at some point , leads you back to Home , and remember that in the end it is all about love .", "author": "Andrew Smith", "url":

June to 29 July, 2021", "content": "Mars feels good in the fiery sign of Leo \u2013 at least he feels better than he did in watery Cancer .\nThe Cosmic Warrior gets a little Leonine attention , and usually finds it to his liking .\nThe vibe of Mars in Leo is a bit like a successful athlete promoting products in television commercials , or even a role in television or film .\nAt the least , it \u2019 s like the obligatory interview with the press after each match or game .\nSometimes , athletes shine in those roles , and sometimes a good athlete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes to presenting in public .\nGreat athletic ability doesn \u2019 t necessarily mean an engaging personality , articulate speech , or even organized thoughts .\nPortugal \u2019 s Cristiano Ronaldo and the U.S. \u2019 s Peyton Manning stand out as great successes ( among many ) , but not all athletes excel in front of a camera .\nMars in Leo is thus a little out of his natural territory , where he \u2019 s asked not only to accomplish , but also to shine .\nThis year , he \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to see individuals making bold moves and demanding recognition with Mars in the Sun \u2019 s home sign .\nWhether they appear as rightfully deserving of glory or boorish depends in part on what they \u2019 ve actually done , but it also matters what mood the public is in to receive their performance .\nAs we have a strong Aquarian vibe at the moment ( the \u2018 moment \u2019 lasting until Pluto leaves the sign in 2044 ) , anyone seeking to capitalize on the Mars-in-Leo energy might want to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show off are likely to fail , and anything that suggests elitism will be a very hard sell with Aquarian egalitarianism on the rise .\nMars \u2019 first task may well be domestic .\nOn the 29th of June he makes a trine to partnership asteroid Juno , who \u2019 s in her husband \u2019 s home sign of Sagittarius .\nThis aspect suggests passion ( Mars rules drive , including the sex drive ) .\nThere will be opportunities to let sexual energy flow into existing partnerships \u2013 although for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go outside of their relationships ( spoiler alert : Mars \u2019 last aspect in Leo is an opposition to Jupiter ) .\nYet with Mars opposite Saturn on June 30/July 1 , it \u2019 s not easy to get away with something .\nThis aspect suggests that we begin July with focus on one thing .\nMultitasking is not advised , but a great deal can be accomplished if we concentrate our energies .\nA more erratic feel prevails on July 3rd , as Mars squares Uranus .\nIn contrast to a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to contain ourselves .\nWatch out for tempers flaring and both internal and external fireworks as we approach July 4th \u2013 we \u2019 ll all be looking to have our \u201c Independence Day \u201d ( the U.S. holiday on the 4th ) .\nGive yourself and others a wide berth if needed , and work off extra energy with sensible exercise .\nAfter his flurry of activity , Mars takes some time off .\nHe next meets with Venus on July 13th , another passionate aspect that is less constrained \u2013 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juno a couple of weeks earlier .\nWith the Moon waxing , we \u2019 ll all have extra energy on hand .\nChiron is stationing to retrograde on the 15th , but is unlikely to spoil the party .\nAs the month ends , Mars squares Ceres on the 27/28th , then goes on to oppose Jupiter on the 29th .\nThese aspects are likely to play out in the collective , perhaps with someone getting to big or too loud for public opinion .\nWith Jupiter at the last degree of Aquarius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although it \u2019 s an open question whether it will stick .\nFire signs get the most of Mars in Leo , so Aries , Leo , and Sagittarius should get ready to make the most of it .\nAir signs also benefit , although Aquarius has about equal odds of finding a fiery partner or an ardent opponent .\nWater signs have a tougher time of it .\nCancer can focus on finances \u2013 but crabs may just be happy to have the warrior out of their house .\nScorpio might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist if someone isn \u2019 t hogging the spotlight .\nPisces feels it at work , where a coworker may gain attention .\nThe fish can make this a very good time to begin an exercise program .\nEarth signs don \u2019 t relate all that directly to Mars in Leo , but could find unexpected help from this celestial energy .", "author": "Agent12 Julija", "url": "https://cosmicintelligenceagency.com/marsinleo2021/", "published": "Fri, 11 Jun 2021 00:26:14 +0000", "published_utc": 1623385574,

situations around this Solstice \u2019 s Capricorn Full Moon nudge our emotional psyche into a sharing , caring mode , and with a responsible stance .\nTo get real \u2013 and practical \u2013 especially about career and family , including our global family , June \u2019 s Full Capricorn Moon offers a seemingly rare element of protective , earthy stability in a still spacey and \u2018 out there \u2019 Metal Ox year , where experiments in life , love and brilliance continue , and keeping an open heart-mind is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially now as the Cancerian Sun reaches a natural turning point .\n\u2606\u263c\u2606 For three days the Sun appears to climax and stand still , resting and paused before Sol \u2019 s emphasis of light shifts to other hemisphere ( Sol = Sun , and Stice = still ( Latin : solstitium ) ) .\nThus , every June 20th-21st the Sun reaches Summer Solstice in the North , with maximum day light ; and Winter in the South , with longest night , all of which is about to change direction .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sun beams brightly upon the Solstice Full Moon , so too the informative trickster healer , Mercury , also altered its path .\n\u2606 Pertinently going forward after a three-week retrograde at home in Gemini , the sign of the Twins , Mercury Direct at such a magically powerful Solar station doubles the need for applied effort to get any message across , particularly issues surrounding obstacles , distractions and struggles due to mixed messages , mental confusion and/or information overload .\nShould you have anything you need to say right now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 Rigel \u2019 , \u2018 The Announcer \u2019 , Mercury \u2019 s final conjunction with \u2018 Rigel \u2019 for a while .\nListening to the same old could be mistaken for deja-vu , but revived spins now demand extra attention and understanding as well as the need to maintain strong morals and integrity , any success or accomplishment is otherwise meaningless and generally short-lived .\n\u2606 To aid one \u2019 s ability to stand in truth , important Fixed Stars continue to beam a heavenly angelic astral presence , due to three ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethical thought , word , and deed : Aldaberan holds open the karmic gate in the East , Formalhaut in the South , and Antares in the West , and all three are now accenting our physical , mental and spiritual determination , plus the triumphs made via challenging quests .\nThe influence of these bright stars , which have been constellating in triple tandem for the past few weeks , will also continue to radiate for another month , also emphasising how respect for another \u2019 s belief and well-being leads to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no mistake : this Solstice Full Moon is a mighty poignant pivotal moment .\nNot only are Sol and his celestial messenger Mercury apparently turning with Archangels watching and guiding , but this Capricorn Full Moon is made all-the-more powerful because the planetary pantheon \u2019 s generous \u2018 great benefic \u2019 , Jupiter , also slowed down to retrograde , along with his compassionate counterpart , oceanic Neptune .\n\u2606 Both Jupiter and Neptune are currently in the sign of the Fish , Pisces .\nWith the zodiac \u2019 s teacher Jupiter being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neptune the modern : there is much to learn about the way we humans flow through our watery emotional world , as well as our actual oceans .\nConnected by a silver cord , Pisces sees one fish pointing to heavens , and the other to earth .\nInterestingly , the two co-rulers of the two magically bound Fish eventually meet in April 2022 , when it could be obvious to all how healthy water is essential for harmonious humans and a habitable earth .\nWatery Neptune goes direct at the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter degrees of experimental Aquarius , going all the way back to 22\u00b0 in the sign of the \u2018 Water Bearer \u2019 , showing how contained and supported we feel within society , as well as in our tribe , friendship groups and teams .\nOur basic human need is to feel secure with one another to nurture each other , be creative , inspire , and have fun .\nAll our distancing has trained a certain kind of discipline , but still the deeply sensitive need to snuggle-up close , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AND Venus both in Cancer = very cosy , if only the mind wouldn \u2019 t keep drifting towards work to be done and professional goals .", "author": "Agent12 Julija", "url": "https://cosmicintelligenceagency.com/full-mooncapriconsolstice/", "published":

of the branches and the hum of the bees , inebriated with the nectar of the heathers .\nAt one with sound , his mind no longer attached to the endless stream of inner chatter , wanders up and beyond

of a car engine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm .\nStruggling to return his gaze to the forest , the landscape bleeds and morphs , as trees give way to walls , as his eye closes and his eyes open .\nMeditation

allow the doe to run through him , or at very least to have softened and allowed love to emanate more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the doe could have sensed that he was not a threat .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve much work to do \u201d , Little Spirit reflected to his Ma-ster .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve not yet reached a state of grace and calmness , especially when confronted .\nMy go-to emotion is that of fear .\nIt is something I need to look at.\n\u201d \u201c Little one , do not fret .\nThe doe was merely protecting pure lOve .\nIt is what the feminine does best .\nIt is wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and courage .\nIt stands firm to protect who and what it loves and believes in .\nBut the feminine responds strongly when it senses that who or what she loves is under threat .\nSo I would ask you to reflect on

winding or thick the path appears to get , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the way for you to remember .\nThe youth of the deer , its curiosity and willingness to approach , speaks of the need to tread your paths with fearlessness and innocence .\nRemember , Little One , that at the level the deeper heart you are a pure and playful being .\nYou reflect the innocence of the Divine .\nThe totem of the fawn is one that can be held in your archetypal identity to remind you to soften to others , open yourself and be vulnerable in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c But what of the doe , Ma-Ster ?\n\u201d , ask Little Spirit \u201c The appearance of the doe suggests that the Universe wants you to stop what you are doing and just to surrender to the moment .\nTo stop the busyness , the over thinking and the anxiety created by being in two places at once .\nHer presence is a reminder that you need to stop and listen to your intuition .\nShe is also a reminder that whilst the feminine is gentle and the protective , she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both innocence and love.\n\u201d \u201c Does that mean that I am not trusting myself and the messages that I am receiving from within ?\n\u201d \u201c Possibly , Little One .\nBut only you can truly know that .\nA fawn may at times approach danger , like a hunter .\nYet its innocence compels it forward in the chance that it may soften a confused heart .\nRemember that you are at times \u201c a fawn on the path \u201d , innocent , pure , and gentle at the core of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget your true nature when the complexity and excitement of life distracts .\nThe winding roads of your paths can and will always take you back to peace and love if you let it.\n\u201d \u201c Thank you Ma-Ster .\nI will reflect more on this meditation \u201d .\nThis has been a time of great change , which is ultimately sure to be positive , life renewing and spiritually uplifting , but fraught with its own challenges , emotional and psychological adjustments , and trials of acceptance and surrender .\nLittle Spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deer serves as a reminder to call upon the principles of unconditional love , patience , innocence and grace .\nYou are being reminded to be gentle with yourself and others , to embrace the organic graceful flow of life , and to love others with an open heart and clear mind .\nYou are also being called to stand up for what you need to protect , to engage the Yin Warrior within you , as the New Moon in Gemini , falls in close alignment with the Amazon Star , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder of the Hunter constellation , Orion .\nThe sign of Gemini speaks of the need to listen to both the voices of logic and intuition , allowing neither to dominate the other , as well as to take the time to speak forth as well as listen to those within your world .\nThe existence of Gemini , or Mutable Air , reminds us of the importance of what we speak of , returns to us .\nTherefore the world you live in is merely a reflection of what you have envisioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call for Little Spirit to realise that fear was his go-to reality when faced with a surprise .\nIt is his path to find what he has gained from developing a relationship with fear and to try to return to a state of grace and innocence .\nThe presence of the dear is merely a reminder that innocence will always be protected by the feminine , as the Yin warrior is not a man \u2019 s projection of the fighter woman , as the Marvel superhero ladies have been depicted .\nBut the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to describe someone who defends core \u2018 feminine \u2019 values , regardless of gender .\nStanding up in defence of children \u2019 s rights ; leading humanitarian efforts ; participating on peace missions ; or stand as a protector of the environment , the consciousness through which Bellatrix draws forth , stands her ground and pushing for change in the face of adversity , injustice or inequality .\nThe New Moon in June is an annular ( or partial ) eclipse , seen from Easter North American , Northern Europe and Northern Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebirth of the Mind-Light ( Retrograde Mercury in conjunction with the Sun , the topic of my most recent webinar ) .\nTherefore not a normal New Moon , the opportunity to open up to the fawn \u2019 s innocence can open new doors to yourself and your relationships that will accelerate your spiritual and emotional evolution .\nBe not wary of the path for it always , at some point , leads you back to Home , and remember that in the end it is all about love .", "author": "Andrew Smith", "url":

a gloriously crystalline and bright Full Moon , Luna first encounters controlling Pluto , Lord of the shadowy underworld and corporate empire and , indeed , anyone or anything else that thinks it , or they , are above the law .\nPluto often has a partner behind the wheel , sporting popped-up collar and dark glasses \u2013 suspiciously conspicuous so no one can miss him .\nOne therefore has every right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dares dampen a party weekend , just as the majestic Leo Sun radiates opposite the super-friendly Aquarius Moon \u2013 a Full Moon that usually signals serious merrymaking and future-link networking .\nYet everyone knows corona is rampant \u2013 somewhere .\nAnd with the mantra \u2018 it \u2019 s not what you know , but who you know \u2019 rattling the mind , you may still

locomotive shaped horoscope , which it has done for most of the year \u2013 and continues to do so well into September , ruthlessly driving agenda and policy as if there were no tomorrow .\nOf course , there is an element of truth in that credo : tomorrow never comes .\nAll we ever have is now and , unless you are a practiced meditator , even that tends to hang in a delicate atomically vibrating balance of probable \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOW for Fixed and Water signs : Taurus , Leo , Scorpio , Aquarius ; Scorpio , Cancer , Pisces .\nCapricorn , respectively .\nNote the challenging and macabre motto of the sign which sets the tone of the Full Moon scope : Scorpio ( which Pluto rules ) : \u201c That which doesn \u2019 t do you in , will only make you stronger \u201d .\nPluto \u2019 s lesson is to therefore release all that no longer serves and regenerate , to leave a strong and lasting legacy for generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the psychological and physical changes we go through , playing one \u2019 s part in a ( mass ) transformational process is a sensitive matter .\nPluto \u2019 s closeness to the Moon gives the first of our current three-night Full Moon an emotionally charged and dramatic , fixed intensity .\nGo easy .\nTry not to act like a despot .\n\u2606 Remember how a Full Moon phase lasts three nights , and how moonbeams can be totally different from one night to the next .\nAt the Full Moon on Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straddled by two heavy-weight disciplinarians , Pluto is on one side , being left behind ; and taskmaster , Saturn is on the other ( and for many it will feel like late 2019 all over again ) .\nFor the freedom-loving Aquarian Moon , this is not an easy fit by any means ; and sensing the weight of responsibility within a karmic squeeze may require an inventive approach to assuage any kind of awkwardness .\n\u2606 By the time the Moon starts to wane \u2013 which she does the minute she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to approach and pass Saturn with confident caution @ 18:25UT on the 24th .\nAt this point we \u2019 re called to step up to mark , to confront the year \u2019 s most challenging aspect : \u2018 Saturn Square Uranus \u2019 .\nWith the year of the Metal Ox \u2019 s collective celestial challenge to \u2018 think outside the box \u2019 , \u2018 reshape the box \u2019 , or even \u2018 throw the box out \u2019 and enter the egalitarian circle ; whichever , the mission is to keep the flame of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already been said about this year \u2019 s Saturn-Uranus square .\nSuffice to say those with fixed planets 10-16\u00b0are constellating around and within \u2018 the box \u2019 on deeply personal levels ; yet we are all currently in a closing and potentially stabilising phase of a cycle that began in 1988 and will end in 2032 .\nThese next ten years are therefore crucial for organising ( personal ) humanitarian ambitions .\n\u2606 Interestingly , this crucial Full Moon point within this Saturn-Uranus Square sees the planets involved all positively interlinked \u2013 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful ways .\nBear with me , to synthesis this planetary relationship entails a complex 5-way association of rulership \u2019 s : \u2022 Uranus in Taurus is in the sign of the Moon \u2019 s exaltation ( Taurus ) .\n\u2022 This ( and the next Zodiacal Blue ) Full Moon beams in the sign of altruistic Aquarius .\n\u2022 From the esoteric viewpoint , the Moon is the hierarchical ruler of Aquarius , meaning that within the \u2018 Global Family \u2019 selflessness is the way to enlightenment !\n\u2022 Karmic Saturn is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such astral connections indicate relations with authority as well as ( distant ) friends is highlighted and , with a little bit of recently discovered know-how ( remember that Mercury Rx/Eclipse in June ) , planned as well as spontaneous events and situations should go well and be friendly and counteract any disappointment .\nMostly , these planets suggest a major opportunity to live one \u2019 s life for the benefit of others , so that one \u2019 s lifeforce doesn \u2019 t get wasted on the self-cherishing ego .\nHey , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let \u2019 s think long-term\u2026 \u2606 It \u2019 s also beneficial to understand that in \u2018 mundane astrology \u2019 ( political astrology ) it is the Moon which represents \u2018 the people \u2019 , i.e.\n, you and me .\nSo that whenever Spirit Sun shines from its home position in artistic Leo and is reflected by the Aquarius Moon , the Moon represents the creative power of an individual within humanity .\nTherefore , it is during an Aquarian Full Moon that we , the people , like to express our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the fun part of being human !\nPooling those talents within your greater social framework also brings the Aquarian age that bit closer , instead of waiting another couple of hundred years we can get on with the Aquarian subject at hand : making the world a more equal place for all beings .\nOther key factors worthy of note in this Full Moon horoscope : \u2606 The Moon is also conjunct Fixed Star \u2018 Altair \u2019 accenting determination and bold initiative .\nIf you have planets at 1\u00b0Aquarius , take note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your ability to embrace the future \u2013 and watch out for being pushy or bombastic .\n\u2606 Sun Sextiles BML and the Moon trines , to create the first easy and major connection to the lights since the symbolic wild woman moved into Gemini ( where she stays for nine months ) .\nWatch out for any reaction should women be left out of important dialogue .\n\u2606 The fabulous conjunction between Mars and Venus continues for a couple more weeks .\nNow Venus is conjunct Hygiea , asteroid Goddess of Healing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watcher of the North \u2019 , otherwise known as the \u2018 Heart of the Lion \u2019 , which has now progressed into Virgo , the sign of strong women not owned by any man .\nThis triple conjunction of Mars , Venus , and Hygiea , in late Leo and early Virgo are also all opposite expansive Jupiter , magnifying the import of relationships ( note how Jupiter will back at this same point , but without relationship planets , at the end of 2021 ) .\nJupiter is now retrograding from Pisces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our second Moon in Aquarius in a row , called the \u2018 Zodiacal Blue Moon \u2019 22nd August , when the Moon is again accents the liberty to experiment .\nThe planets currently inform how , on this first Aquarian Moon , that we first need to illuminate our shadow and shade and transform from deep within the heart , with love .\nThen we can experience Jupiter \u2019 s blessings .\nOne day after the Full Moon , Luna conjuncts Jupiter bringing success home ; so it will be good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going down on the 25th July , as it there could be a second flourish and fruition late August .\n\u2606 One last note for the ongoing Metal Ox Year is the almost year-long feature of Neptune with Pallas Athena = plan your dream .\nWith that I wish you all a very happy Aquarius Full Moon !\nAnd before I go , just to mention how the Last Quarter Moon sees the recent Fire Trine reignite for spiritual insight and soulful revelation .", "author":

.\nYou \u2019 ve been there .\nWe all have .\nYou have heard the stories .\nAnd it is always about someone else .\nOpera singer Enrico Caruso ( Jupiter in Leo ) was told that he couldn \u2019 t sing ;

Sun in Leo ) felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught herself to cook , opening up a pathway to fulfilment ; Enid Blyton ( Sun in Leo ) was rejected by publishers over a thousand times !\nYet each ignored the rejections , the slights , the dismissals , dug deep and continued to believe in themselves .\nI can not say for certain but I am sure that their heart sank and they plunged into a dark abyss of doubt , frustration and worthlessness when judgement was passed down on their creativity .\nYet within each there existed something deep ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those illusory limitations .\nThat something was their ability to tap into their fixed fire \u2013 that indomitable inner flame , ever burning , ever constant , ever lighting their path .\nHaving those feelings is not the sole dominion of being born with the Sun illuminating the consciousness pathway called Fixed Fire , or Leo .\nNor do you have planets in Leo to have felt alone ; to have tried to run away from yourself , or from love ; or to have felt lacking in inner belief and confidence .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ which exists within everyone , corresponds to the stage of our psycho-spiritual development wherein the spark of life becomes strong and enduring .\nWhere Leo falls in your chart shows you where you are actively developing this inner conviction over the course of your life and where you need to trust your inner light and to spend time nourishing your own skills regardless of any external factors .\nThe development of inner confidence is done by truly knowing yourself and accepting yourself as you are .\nIt is only after you begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what makes you tick and can help you develop self-respect .\nBy connecting with what brings you passion ; what makes you feel alive ; by listening to , and trusting , your

energetic conditions of the most recent weeks may have left you both raw and tumultuous .\nDarkened clouds of self-doubt , fear , isolation and frustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awakened soul .\nKnow that it is necessary to reignite YOUR FLAME after a \u2018 healing \u2019 experience as you are left questioning yourself as your confidence dwindles .\nOnce reignited , your fire can not only give you a deeper sense of purpose , but it can sustain you through life \u2019 s vicissitudes .\nWithout fire you can forget your connection to spirit ; without inner purpose , your soul \u2019 s intention may struggle to find expression ; without vision , you can not create intention and therefore reality .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion and purpose then the enslaving emotional states \u2013 fear , doubt and insecurity \u2013 can be dispelled .\nAs you develop a grounded sense of self-belief and self-confidence , you can walk along any path , integrating all \u2018 healing \u2019 experiences , as you are no longer dependent upon the external world as a gauge of how you are doing .\nThis means you are to open your heart .\nAnd to open your heart completely means that you need to make yourself vulnerable !\nNot an easy task to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt takes courage .\nThere always remains the possibility to getting hurt .\nBut without opening yourself to vulnerability , love can not enter the heart .\nThe veil that protects you can also give you the illusion of being unloved .\nYet that is not possible , especially if you consider that love is not merely a decision to extend your feelings towards another soul .\nLove is the oceanic current that flows from gOd , life giving , life sustaining , life animating .\nLove brings this world into being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love offers hope .\nLove

sing about as it has significantly more meaning and sparkle than an ordinary calendar Blue Moon .\nA Double Blue Moon is rarer still , only coming round , well\u2026 once in a Blue Moon !\nBut what is a Blue Moon ?\nAnd what makes the Full Moon Sunday the 22nd of August doubly Blue ?\nThe Moon certainly doesn \u2019 t look blue in the night sky .\nYet it did when the Indonesian volcano Krakatoa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green and our Moon blue .\nHopefully , we won \u2019 t witness such a spectacle in our lifetime , but one can never tell in this fast-changing world .\nEven climate science has issues with its models .\nBecause events and situations surrounding unusual celestial turns , such as the Seasonal & Zodiac Blue Full Moon is uniquely extraordinary , more so when the Full Moon is in quirky and spacy , humanitarian Aquarius , the friendly techno-beeping sign that likes science and stats , and spaghetti TV dinners .\nTake note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now nurture your soul .\nWe are living through exceptional times ; friends and support groups are an important part of healing trauma and fear .\nIndeed , the ripples of January 2020 \u2019 s hard-hitting , once-in-a-lifetime , Jupiter-Saturn-Pluto conjunction ( and the current Saturn-Uranus Square ) plus all the situations which have since arisen could continue to be felt for several years to come .\nAnd although Blue Moons are not as rare as triple conjunction karma , our next Blue Moon is August 2023 ; the next major triple conjunction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !\n.\nSo , what is a Blue Moon ?\nThe accepted notion is that a Blue Moon is the second of two Full Moon \u2019 s in the same calendar month .\nA \u2018 Seasonal \u2019 Blue Moon , however , is when there are four Full Moons in a season instead of three , from Solstice to Equinox , for example .\nAnd it is the third Full Moon of the four , like now , which is considered \u2018 Blue \u2019 .\nThis particular Blue Full Moon in Aquarius also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of \u2018 The Lights \u2019 ( Sun & Moon ) , going from new-moon-to-full-moon .\nThe Full Moon of each Lunation comes before the intention-setting New Moon .\nWe can be setting our intentions with the New Moon and align to our true lunisolar nature .\nNote that a \u2018 calendar \u2019 Blue Moon takes place every two or three years , while the \u2018 seasonal \u2019 Blue Moon has a recurring 19-year cycle ( within which there are seven Blue Moons ) , accenting ancestral magical and karmic soul connections .\nYou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to 22nd August 2002 , or even August 22nd/23rd 1983 ; better still , check 29\u00ba Aquarius in your scope ; note if anything connects then to now , from which to learn/improve/enlighten .\nIncidentally , I checked back on these dates , from a skydancing point of view , to discover the days around these Seasonal & Zodiacal Full Blue Moon \u2019 s are marked by a great deal of extreme weather : floods , hurricanes and earthquakes , yup , we \u2019 ve got them again .\nWe \u2019 ve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Leo Sun \u2013 the radiance which illuminates our karmically connected Blue Moon .\nTo elucidate : a Zodiacal Full Blue Moon is when we have two consecutive Full Moons in the same sign , like now , as the Moon is again in freedom-loving , public-spirited Aquarius , just as it was last month July 24th .\nThe first Full Zodiacal Moon is always at the start of a sign \u2013 in our case the universal sign Aquarius ( the sign of the Moon \u2019 s hierarchical rulership that upholds the global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets the stage for recognising creativity , unique ideas , open-minded networking , and team building .\nA second Full Moon four weeks later raises further awareness of our interconnectivity at 29\u00ba Aquarius .\nThe all-important \u2018 anaretic \u2019 degree is the last degree of a sign .\nBy the time the Full Blue Moon traverses an entire sign , taking one moonth to reach the final degree ( and , by consequence , ( astro-tech alert ) : the sign \u2019 s various decanate , term , face , aspect and dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this last \u2018 anaretic \u2019 degree is often referred to as a \u2018 karmic \u2019 degree , one that signifies an experiential , intellectual and emotional understanding of the sign that goes through a karmic ripening .\nAt the beginning of Aquarius has dynamic fixity ; having a point to move from gives a sense of distance and space ; while the end is totally wired , electrified swiftly cutting into the edge of space with kindred spirits united by diversity and the understanding that it takes all sorts to make One whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jupiter in Aquarius invented social media ( It \u2019 s true , 24 years ago I sent my first email with a yahoo account from an old Atari in a London club called Megatripolis , all the way to my Indian friend in Kajaraho ! )\n; and to be part of the experimental , humanitarian interconnected Aquarian Age , that was duly seeded December 2020 , at the time of the 200-year Great Solstice Appulse , Jupiter continues to slow down , to remind that equality , friendship and freedom are as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thrive .\nA Zodiacal Blue Moon also connects us to the 13-lunar-month year .\nIt does so now as the majestic Sun is at home in brave Leo , and conjunct Fixed Star , Regulus : \u2018 The Heart of Lion \u2019 which , by precession , is now also aligned with the Sacred Goddess , art zero Virgo .\nRegulus empowers the Sun as it changes signs towards Virgo ( the C*I*A \u2019 s inception day ) only hours after culmination , for the Lion Heart Regulus assures the courageous feminine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as morality is intact , intention pure-hearted , and revenge not the motivation .\nBeing aware of the phases of the Sun and Moon is more natural way to tune into the world .\nLunar living allows us to focus our intentions with regular monthly periods of opportunity to grow , release .\nand balance emotions and hormones more easily , aligned with the cosmos , with awareness .\nSo when these super-divine Seasonal & Zodiacal Blue Moons come around , every three-five years , we instinctively realign with natures rhythms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vibration we inhabit .\nAs such , this double Blue Moon is actually quite rare , especially when we add the 19-year soliluna metonic cycle .\nIt also helps to know how the heavens are resetting our inner-being .\nI find this most welcome during times of uncertainty .\nInterestingly , humans only began to see blue as a colour a few thousand years ago , which is just yesterday in the cosmic scheme of things .\n\u2730 For our second Full Zodiacal and Seasonal Blue Moon in unconventional and futuristic Aquarius , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is futuristic , electric neon , sharp and strong ; an eccentric \u2018 Yves Klein Blue \u2019 , for instance , that emerged from the swinging 60 \u2019 s at the initial dawning of the Age of Aquarius : with a blue so deep , bright and clear , that it zaps you into the 21st century with digital precision , to envelope the world-body with a deeply healing lapis lazulite blue .\nThe colour blue has powerful restorative vibrations , wavelengths and qualities that can not be ignored : blue calms the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat chakra \u2019 , inspiring truth in understanding and communication .\nWearing or meditating upon the colour blue can even lower our blood pressure and produce a certain serenity .\nBlue suggests we are in our flow .\n\u2730 All the above is also handy during a double Full Blue Moon horoscope that also holds a \u2018 Mutable Grand Cross \u2019 , plus a \u2018 Grand Air Trine \u2019 : Love Wisdom stimulates our rational Will .\nIn our flow , and intellectually stimulated .\nOn the dark side , electronic blue screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brain is tired ( and circadian rhythm shifts to bedtime ) .\nIf you \u2019 re having trouble sleeping , the astral advise in cosmic energy circles is to switch off the wifi to tune into \u2018 the blue \u2019 and your natural healing aura , andpsychically alkalise the body and soothe the heartmind before sleeping , some people think sky , some sea , some the colour of their beloved \u2019 s eyes .\n\u2730 Although , there is little to fat chance of getting more than your share of zzzed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up this Full Moon \u2019 s culmination : be aware this is actually a time when feeling twilightzoned as Luna reaches culmination is justifiable , even if you haven \u2019 t yet succumbed to the lockdown tipple , because just seven minutes later the Moon moves into Pisces @ 12:09 .\nAnd @ 21:35UT , only a few hours later , the Sun moves into Virgo .\nSeasonal Elementals in our favour in the run-up to the Full Moon are Air and Fire , changing to Earth and Water , nine minutes into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also has a different expression of blue .\n\u201c Blessing must arise from within your own mind .\nIt is not something that comes from outside.\n\u201d HH14thDL", "author": "Agent12 Julija", "url":

.\nExact conjunctions of Jupiter and Pluto take place April 6th and Nov 25th at the 23rd degree of Capricorn .\nEris will be at 23\u00b0 and 24\u00b0 Aries in square to these conjunctions of 2020 and in 2020 to Pluto .\nAs we can see in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play a significant role as she is has been dynamically aligned with the unprecendented chaos of our times .\nEven though she maybe relatively new to astro consciousness , we need to consider that the information shared and gathered about new planet discoveries , and their meaning , do no longer need 100 \u2019 s of years to be taken understood , as information travels much faster these days , insights are shared much more readily than they were 100 \u2019 s of years ago , even 10 or 20 years ago !\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to learning and information , viral updates , memes , looking up and researching articles , comparing charts , talking about it all with comrades , endless astro webinars etc are all at our fingertips and flooding in information to us constantly .\nMany astrologers would say the new discoveries like Eris are to \u201c New \u201d to work with .\nYet when we consider how fast info travels these days , it could be seen to be actually quite , Erisian or Eris like and viral !\nAlthough new to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Eris , certainly indicates her living up to her name , as the Goddess of Discord .\nEris , not one to sit back and take being left out of an invitation to the wedding of Peleus and Thetis which is being attended by all the Gods and Goddesses , except for her ( not invited , due to her discordant behaviour , and what we \u2019 d call being an potentially unpleasant and disruptive guest ) , she devises a plan that sets a series of events in motion , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipated .\nBeing deeply offended at not being invited , in spite , she throws a golden apple into the midst of the goddesses at the party , that is engraved \u201c to the fairest \u201d , leading to what seems the first rigged beauty pageant , with shades of the wicked witch from Snow White .\nAs it transpired , three goddesses laid claim to the apple : Aphrodite , Hera and Athena .\nZeus , as the chief Olympian , decides Paris , the prince of Troy , should decide the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is his wife , the other his lover , the other his daughter .\nThe three goddesses appeared before the young prince , each secretly offering him gifts and bribes for being chosen as the winner .\nHe chose Aphrodite , swayed by her promise to bestow upon him , the most beautiful woman in the world , Helen .\nHelen was the wife of Spartan King Menelaus , and Helen became known as the woman whose beauty would cast a thousand ships .\nSmall actions have big consequences , as Eris \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trojan War .\nEris is the most massive dwarf planet in the Solar System , exceeding Pluto \u2019 s mass by 28 % .\nIt was a serious contender to be a tenth planet but failed to meet the criteria set out by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 .\nDiscovered in 2005 , named in 2006 Eris \u2019 discovery was inadvertently also responsible for the demotion of Pluto , as the discovery of these dwarf planets led to the promotion of asteroid Ceres as well !\nTimely to say the least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status was announced in August 2006 .\nEris was named in September 2006 , after being called Planet X \u2013 Xena since discovery in 2005 , coming from Xena warrior Princess a TV series of 2001 , as decided by discoverer Mike Brown .\nI always thought Xena would be a great name for the planet .\nBut as Eris is a warrior Goddess as well , who loved blood \u2013 it all seemed to suit very well , being the mythological sister of Ares who also loved to fight and spill blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call Eris the Agent of Chaos .\nIn 2006 , Eris was named , at the same time the movie Al Gore \u2019 s \u201c The Inconvenient Truth \u201d came out , as well as in Oct 2006 the blood thirsty series Dexter came on air , where a forensic technician specialising in blood spatter pattern analysis for the fictional Miami Metro Police Department , led a secret parallel life as a vigilante serial killer .\nErisian indeed !\nLooking further into Eris , we certainly get a sense of the femme fatale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changer as goes with her moniker Goddess of Discord .\nWe see her prominent in femme fatale figures , activists and radicals of all sorts .\nRemembering anyone with planets in Aries would have Eris conjunctions , as Eris has been in Aries since 1922 and continues to be till 2040 \u2019 s .\nEris has an extremely elliptical orbit and spends most of her time in Aries , up to 123 years , and the least time in Libra , how suitable .\nFor her to pop up in this century and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World War was the name of the game , in this century the 2100 \u2019 s we see her playing out as the part of the rising Sacred Feminine , against the imbalance of the controls of Patriarchy .\nRadical astro twins Angelina Jolie and Russell Brand , born only a few hours apart , both have Eris conjunct Mars .\nAngelina quite publicly announcing the cutting off of breast tissues to avoid possible breast Cancer , amongst many other things , shows her bold feminine moves as a brave independent female .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth , comedian , social guru , speaking up about changing our social norms , also brings out Eris \u2019 radical nature , by always bringing up topics , and raising issues that many won \u2019 t talk about through his social media airwaves.\n!\nSteve Jobs , fittingly revolutionised our computer world , has Eris conjunct his Moon , as he certainly chucked an Apple into global consciousness , giving us all a big taste of what we can \u2019 t live without , computers , keeping up with constant upgrades .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1976 , even has Eris conjunct the Sun .\nThe violent female and fem fatale also comes out strong in the movies directed by Quentin Tarantino , like the Kill Bill series , and his other blood thirsty movies Reservoir Dogs , Pulp fiction , etc .\nNot surprisingly Tarantino has Eris conjunct Sun /Mercury in Aries .\nLuc Besson , director of \u201c La Femme Nikita \u201d 1990 one of the first iconic Femme Fatal movies depicts a violent remorseless female , Besson has Eris conjunct his MC .\nWatch for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as she is not always just a blood thirsty killer , but stands out by deliberately creating radical moves that reverberate and eventually have great influence on our culture and society .\n\u2022 None The Eris archetype manifests as a reaction to established authority , not necessarily violent , by those who raise issues and speak the truth or don \u2019 t bow down to authority .\n\u2022 None Being left out , ostracised for being different \u2022 None Putting up a fight against inequality , unfairness , injustice ( Think Pussy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their performance in a church in 2012 in Moscow Russia , when Saturn was opposite Eris in Libra ) \u2022 None Needing to speak out , do something about something .\n\u2022 None The Butterfly effect \u2013 when a butterfly flutters it s wings in the Amazon , this can cause a storm in Australia .\n\u2022 None No action is too small !\nWe are reminded that our actions , however small can lead to and reverberate much further than we can imagine , given us a key in understanding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help shift global dynamics as active agents of change .\n\u2022 The viral nature of Social media , trends , fast track news etc- Eris born in the same time frame .\nWe may all feel very much left out in the decisions made by the gods , the ruling elites of our societies , the white supremacists that feel they own the world , the privileged one percent that claim superiority just because they have money !\nWe may feel helpless in being able to change the course of anything .\nYet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to cut ties with the past , to claim the future , to stand up for injustice and unfairness in our governments and our societies .\nI see Eris as the nudge we need to play our role , ( without violence and bloodshed \u2013 times have changed ) for fairness and equality , for all genders , races and sexual preferences .\nIn our own small ways , collectively the ripples of change are moving through the world of which the consequences are not yet quite evident , but are definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in quite obviously reflects .\nThis C*I*A has Eris at 17\u00b0 Aries conjunct our Moon and North Node at 14\u00b0 Aries opposite Jupiter on the South Node at 17\u00b0 Libra and was born in the same year as Eris , August 23 2005 .\nWe like to think we played our role in elevating the way the outside world looked at astrology .\nIt was the right time back in 2005 for us to begin to wear astrology like a badge of pride , out there for the world to seem beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Signs and their limited scope , to help play our role to put it \u201c out \u201d there .\nWe were adamant to use our own astro language , not dumb things down , not try to conform and meld to how everyone else was doing it .\nWe were always very keen to show and teach others along the way , the help peak interest , to help outsiders understand how astrology and cosmic cycles worked , how we were all part of them .\nWe enticed them to want to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our posts , videos and reports .\nIt was the right time and the right place and the gift of the internet and social media helped us enormously to push the mission along .\nWe only need to look at where astrology is now , how many now understand the language and the broader concepts , much more than they did when we began our mission .\nIt was our intended mission after all , and of course we are not the only one \u2019 s responsible .\nBut we certainly did make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contingency and astro consciousness floating around we can continue to make it part of conscious directions for change in our world !\nI often call the C*I*A Agents the \u201c Agents of Chaos \u201d , as a bunch of individuals with a common goal .\nAgent of Chaos also reflecting the GET SMART series of the 1960 \u2019 s , where spy Agents worked for \u201c Control \u201d chasing the organisation of \u201c Chaos !\n\u201d .\nI have natal Jupiter conjunct Eris and always knew that there was much more that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and loved , and it needed a better reputation in our world .\nOf note is also the publishing of Rick Tarnas \u2019 s most informative tome , Cosmos and Psyche in early 2006 , a grand volume that took him 30 years to write , on the correspondence between planetary alignments and patterns of human history .\nThe book traversed the halls of academia as did his previous book the Passion of the Western Mind and changed the view of many people previously unrelated to astrology .\nRick Tarnas has Eris conjunct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nYoung Greta Thunberg has Eris at 19\u00b0 Aries and a Moon in Capricorn , her birth time is unknown , yet we can see her radical and bold nature could very well embody a square between the two , with perhaps Eris in a prominent place in her chart too .\nEris also trines Pluto and shares Aries with BML and Ceres .\nGreta almost single handedly started the Climate Change revolution from a park bench in Stockholm .\nShe took action and spread the word , and her actions rippled throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David Attenborough has his South Node at 19\u00b0 Capricorn and North Node 19\u00b0 Cancer , on the planetary Nodes of Pluto , squared by Eris since her discovery and significantly has natal Eris at the Zero point of the zodiac of Aries , born in 1926 .\nAnother interesting note is that in the Discovery Chart for Eris Jan 5 2005 , Greta is born just 2 days and 2 years before has the same degree of Eris 19\u00b0 Aries .\nBoth holding the strong Capricorn signature , also very much these days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feminine , the earth and her resources , out of the greedy and uninspired hands of the patriarchy .\nCapricorn is indeed a feminine sign , yet often regarded as being masculine as it is ruled by Saturn .\nThe discovery chart of Eris has Jupiter opposite ( as does this C*I*A ) , an encouragement to speak out the truth in many ways !\nHave you found your role in the Chaos of our times ?\nInto which realm would you throw the apple of discord to

retained within you as an essential part of your body .\nLess esoterically , the sympathetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your body \u2019 s unconscious and involuntary actions , when taken out from our body , looks like a tall plant , akin to a tree with a trunk and branches and is also a remembrance of our pre-hominid form .\nYou have retained the ability to talk to nature or matter \u2013 plants , rocks , flowers , landscapes , animals and your body , because of its existence , mirrored within the astrological tradition as the zodiacal sign of Virgo , or Mutable Earth .\nThe term Mutable , refers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the word at large .\nThe element of Earth merely indicates the physical embodiment of consciousness .\nTogether Mutable Earth simply refers to the aptitude to communicate to the \u2018 kingdom \u2019 of incarnation .\nAnd it is an energetic pathway that everyone contains within them irrespectively of whether they first breath was inhaled between the 23rd/ 24th August and 23rd/ 24th September .\nTeeming with life , our world remains immanent , even if it has become increasingly more difficult to \u2018 hear \u2019 the dialogue from Nature so removed we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFurther and further we have moved from the sovereignty of Nature as we worship to the Left and dismiss or deride the Right .\nWe trust artificial medicine more than Nature \u2019 s medicine , even if the former is engaged in legal discourse to patent the bio-chemical makeup of the later , so that it can synthetize in laboratories what Nature has freely available .\nWe traverse over her body , drawn to places that we intuitively know hold intrinsic meaning , yet merely capture on Reels , selfies or photographs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been drawn to those places ?\nAfter all regions of acute beauty , undeveloped by industry , remains the dominant draw of hodophiles .\nAnd yet , many continue to ignore their body \u2019 s intelligence , dismissing their gut screams not to ingest something that is uncomfortable or damaging to it .\nYour body , after all , is not alive .\nYour tummy talking to you is merely a quaint fairy tale we tell children .\nIsn \u2019 t it ?\nMoreover there is a Rennie tablet to deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inability to digest that \u2018 rich \u2019 food ; or a vaccine that works better than your immune system ; or an insurance policy to protect your house from climate change , even though you bought a dwelling built on a flood plain ( after all rivers never flood and it has to be a function of a changing eco-system ) !\nFew , it appears , take the time to question why can \u2019 t I \u2018 stomach \u2019 that food ; why do I need to take several additional medicines to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why can \u2019 t I live close to the river on this beautiful flat plain ?\nUnderstandable , though , when we consider how removed from the world we have become with increasing industrialisation and mechanisation , which have encouraged distancing from the body we live upon and the body we live within .\nWe merely have to take the time to listen .\nAnd yet will we ?\nMany noticed how quickly Nature \u2018 recovered \u2019 when many stopped in April 2020 .\nThe disaster that was Chernobyl was supposed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thriving with teeming life in less than 40 years .\nThe miracle of naturally growing medicinal cannabis or of other healing plants that have eased chronic pain and stopped the spread of certain illnesses .\nThere are so many examples of our Living Nature and yet it is still dismissed and derided by certain facets of modernity .\nInterestingly , and perhaps not coincidentally , as last moved through an Earth sign , at the end of the 1950s to the start of the 1970s , the memory of the animate indigenous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-emerged at the forefront of human consciousness .\nJames Lovelock termed the title \u2013 Gaia \u2013 to account for the Earth as a living entity ; we had myriad environmental crises at prompted awareness of what the technological advances of humanity was doing at its own expense ; and there was a more concentrated movement towards world views that are now terms holistic .\nAs those souls born with that awareness imbued within their psyche came of age , the \u2018 Clean-Up \u2019 generation started to bring to life as professions , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at best .\nBody and mind practises from homeopathy and herbalism to naturopathy and kinesiology became normalised as our westernised society attempted to directly reconnect to Nature herself .\nActive interest in ancient indigenous shamanic practises prompted both scientist and medic to review the intellectual framework inherited from a misunderstanding of the Newtonian mind-set that underpinned much of early modern scientism .\nBreakthroughs in understanding Nature through this holistic paradigm has spurred on archetypally Mutable Earth organisations like the HeartMath Institute and are a reminder to us that Nature is alive and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicating with us .\nAnd yet , as Pluto has once again being moving through an Earth Sign , we have been reminded of the importance of our relationship to our bodies , as further environmental and health crises have plagued the world .\nRegardless of the origins of what looks like a gain-of-function virus , it is no surprise that the world is challenged the way that it is .\nThe overall health of many is poor , despite the incredible technological advances and conveniences we now have .\nMoreover , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own health onto an external agency speaks , aside from deeper and more potentially conspiratorial notions , of a further distancing from Nature and our bodies .\nComplex and all as the current situation is , and not for one moment suggesting that we should not be looking towards protecting those genuinely vulnerable , there has been little talk of true health care within the Irish system , and I would imagine in many other countries .\nHow many people do you know consume substances that you know that they know are toxic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you know are conscious of what they put into their system , in terms of food , but are still happy to take synthetic products for recreational stimulation or \u2018 medical \u2019 purposes , claiming that they can do a three day detox as a form of counteraction ?\nAnd that is not even to mention the current divisive issue that labels someone anti-science or anti-medicine if you happen to express concerns about the potential long term implications of taking something that is currently on trial .\nAs the Sun and Moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign of Virgo on the 7th of September , I would invite you to set intentions regarding how you communicate with your body and with Nature itself .\nAnd that does not merely mean you talking to yourself and chastising your tummy for the covid-spread !\nI mean , are you listening to your body \u2019 s intelligence , or are you over-riding your \u2018 gut-instinct \u2019 for convenience , entitlement or addiction ?\nDuring the three days preceding the New Moon an opportunity exists to gain a deeper insight into what needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to be replenished and renewed , as the omens arise to support your deeper conscious awareness of something that is currently liminal .\nTaking time to listen to those signals , not dismissing them as a curiosity , enables you to participate in this Mutable state , as the external world mirrors and communicates to your inner world .\nWhat is it that you wish you physically let go of and what new attitude do you wish to commence ?\nThat is a question to hold , as you are being called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being , as you better serve your body and therefore your world .\nPlease remember that it is because of the existence of Virgo , you do not have to give yourself away , nor do you need to sell yourself short , being diluted by the desires and demands of another .\nIt is because of Her existence , you have the opportunity to bring into manifestation a deeper form of service that can enable you to free yourself from the fetters that bind you .\nAnd it is because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are being called to see yourself as a Temple and to both purify and sanctify your body so that within your Wholeness you can more clearly receive .\nI wish you and yours all the best health , internally and externally , for this lunation and beyond .", "author": "Andrew Smith", "url":

, plus a modicum of focus , indicates magic and mystery will be found in the most ordinary places .\nPisces planets bring to light the ability for profound contemplation , taking the heartmind into a place that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yin and yang , aligning male and female , light and dark within the psyche , and therefore also within our environment .\nWith a strong Pisces influence , this Full Moon

@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt is most important to try not to compare yourself to anyone else , and understand that we are always in a process of becoming whole , taking time to grow into our true authentic

doubt .\nSo , while there could be complex conscious or sub-conscious issues to understand \u2013 insecurity , anxiety , fear etc , the most profound Pisces lesson is simple , in that two become one ; and within the spiritual realisation of Oneness comes a tolerance for all beings ; because if we harm and shout and misbehave towards others , we are also doing so to a part of ourselves ( and therein lies the miracle ! )\n.\nIt \u2019 s also worth bearing in mind that in the fourteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neptune , sails through his own domain of the Two Fishes , only once does the watery Lord of the

importance of the watery nature of next April , which will be among three major astrological events of 2022 , and perhaps the most important because of Neptune and Jupiter \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love .\nIt may also be the start of understanding how water is/will be a major issue in the coming years .\nWater is a living element that holds memory and we humans still have a such lot to learn from water \u2019 s inherent behaviour .\nIncidentally , Goddess , Pallas Athena , will be conjunct Spirit Sun , in April , which is a nice exchange of positions for the Goddess of War and Wisdom .\nAlso , from the last time Jupiter and Neptune met in Pisces two things stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1856 ) .\nWe may be able to learn from an American chap called A.E .\nBurnside , who not only invented a new military weapon ( ! )\nbut also a facial hair trend called , you guessed it : sideburns .\nJupiter , Neptune and Pisces are symbols of fashion , after all !\n\u2606 Dynamic Mars is also in the Full Moon mix , right next to the Sun in early degrees Libra ( also ruled by , and in delicate relation with the seductive Venus in Scorpio in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening star ) and also in detriment ) .\nInterestingly , although Mars is not happy in the sign of the scales , it is now conjunct the part of our sky which points towards the centre of our Galactic Supercluster , \u2018 Laneakia \u2019 , which means Immeasurable Heaven .\nOur own Milky Way Galaxy is a part of Laneakia .\nWith Mars here all our actions can be put into scale .\nMars is also in the busy and intellectual , social \u2018

dogs that bark at the moon .\nYet here we are , all with the potential to be bizarrely blessed by the Full Pisces Moon , as the emotional poise of a Pisces kind of Saintly fairy goddess mother can rest gently in the heart centre at any critical moment in time and remain still in one \u2019 s flow .\nAs the astrological \u2018 tone \u2019 of this Full Moon is changeable and mutable , its good to

Moon is in sign of Two Fishes , riding personal and/or collective undercurrents and emotional waves , the forever flowing Pisces instinctively understands there is always a start to any wave @ @ @ @ @

with asteroid warrior Goddess , the strategic Pallas Athena .\nNeptune and Pallas have been travelling together all year and have one last exact union 17th January , to help us organise our (

.\nYet when a Full Moon culminates in Pisces , nothing is what it seems : confusion , distraction and changes of direction are found with every twist and turn .\nThe dominating conjunction of the

contemplation , taking the heartmind into a place that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yin and yang , aligning male and female , light and dark within the psyche , and therefore also within our environment .\nWith a strong Pisces influence , this Full Moon horoscope accents powerful emotional sensitivity and self-development through a recognition and expression of your own unique creative qualities , abilities that help you to feel connected within the competitive world of business , career , and other social situations , both personal and professional .\nIn such a charitable climate , self-expression can even be sacrificed for the benefit of others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt is most important to try not to compare yourself to anyone else , and understand that we are always in a process of becoming whole , taking time to grow into our true authentic selves .\nRemember how we more easily navigate our flow when aligned with \u2018 the divine \u2019 within .\nWe can access our inner , all-forgiving-state-of-bliss-and-cosmic-consciousness ( yes , it does exist within you ) by allowing the self-cherishing ego to let-go and merge and blend with a universal consciousness through whichever Piscean activity turns you on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music , art , swimming , cycling , running , gardening , duvet-diving , dreams , long and luscious candle-lit baths , retreat , prayer , mantra , yoga and meditation are all ways in which we can reach a hypnotic trance where ego consciousness surrenders into the cosmic biofield of ( peak spiritual ) experience , if only for a fleeting moment .\nThis is a wistful Moon where people can and will forget themselves and some may even deny the magic they create .\nSome will even connect to something greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverie and illusion .\nAll which could work nicely for those who escape the mind \u2019 s trappings with the above listed activities .\nOthers could turn to drugs and alcohol and sadly miss an opportunity to become

"content": "Astrology offers precious guidelines for the years to come : it tells us we are seeds of meaning planted by the cosmos and that our vocation is to blossom If astrology helps to lead a more harmonious existence in many ways , its main function in the coming years might be to connect us \u2013 or reconnect us \u2013 to the deepest meanings of life , through the cosmogony , the philosophy , the spiritual vision and the quest for truth its very existence implies .\nNot based on belief or faith , but on an observable and meaningful link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astrology allows a tangible apprehension of the mysteries of existence .\nIts approach returns to us an intimacy with the universe that has been almost entirely lost , because of fear , negative conditionings and wrong orientations , that loss being largely responsible for the current state of our civilization .\nIn contrast to materialism and self-destruction , astrology inspires wonder and adventure through the awakening to the finality of life .\nIt gives birth to a quest , which is the key to the flowering of the individual \u2019 s destiny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world through a rejuvenated collective consciousness You don \u2019 t need to be a futurologist , a sociologist , an astrologer or a specialist of any kind to know that our action during the near future , the next decade , will prove crucial for humankind and for all living beings on Earth .\nThe term Anthropocene refers to the current geological age , viewed as the period during which human activity has been the dominant influence on climate and the environment .\nThe self-destruction trend which possesses us does not seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a real catastrophe , the sixth mass extinction of life on earth .\nI believe that most of us realize that a major part of our problem arises from our consciences , which we seem unable to free from fear , greed , violence and other unwelcome characteristics .\nIt appears obvious that only a radical shift in both individual and collective consciousness might save us .\nAs long as our minds are ruled by personal interest and ignorance , political or economic measures will not prove to be effective .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to extract meaning from it we question what can astrology offer in order to heal the world and help to create a better one ?\nDoes it possess the means to radically impact our philosophical outlook and thus modify our way of life ?\nThis is not a rhetorical question , but applies to the here and now as we are currently determining humanity \u2019 s future for many generations to come .\nAstrology , philosophy and the meaning of life The vast majority of our contemporaries appear to lead utilitarian lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and security , and mostly devoid of inspiration , direction , and meaning .\nThis goes a long way towards explaining why we find ourselves in this situation .\nOur brains and hearts are made to question and seek answers , as history over many millennia has shown .\nOnce we get food , clothes and shelter , we seek love and beauty and we wonder about the meaning to life .\nIt is in our nature , and to forget it darkens the mind and brings discontent , gloom , and eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital role that astrology plays as it fully embodies that \u2018 quest for meaning \u2019 state of mind .\nVarious forms of astrology were discovered by many different cultures , as early as prehistory , because the heavenly splendor caught our attention .\nAbove us , so far out of reach , everything looked majestic , untouched by death and certainly closer to the notion of the sacred .\nWe felt awed by its sparkling order , so alien from our chaotic lives and confused thinking .\nNot only did it look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marvel at , but we discovered that its mathematical perfection was somehow related to us as Plato exclaimed in the Timaeus : \u2018 God invented and gave us the sight , so that in contemplating the revolutions of intelligence in heaven , we might apply them to the revolutions of our own thought , which , although disordered , are related to the imperturbable revolutions of heaven.\n\u2019 To unveil the intimate relationship that our psyches and our destinies sustain with celestial geometry was a significant step ; nature seemed to have left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its hidden mechanisms .\nOf course , in the Greek philosopher \u2019 s world , the bond between nature and humanity was not yet severed ; we were part of nature and naturally looking to it for guidance .\nMoreover , the universe , life , and consciousness had to signify something , and astrology was a key to their comprehension .\nThe Uranian age and the golden age of astrology The idea that astrology can reposition the quest for meaning at the very heart of our consciences does not imply a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past .\nOn the contrary , our new revolutionary and fast-changing world , that is , the Uranian world , suits astrology perfectly .\nUranus was discovered in 1781 when the American and French revolutions , and most notably the outbreak of the industrial era , altered the face of the world .\nLinked to revolution , creative thinking , psychology , as well as to all new technologies , Uranus quickly proved to be the key planet for astrologers , given its remarkable omnipresence in their birth charts .\nIn keeping with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown off the image of an old lady wrapped in her mantle of traditions and thousand-year-old superstitions .\nThis has disintegrated to the point where we can consider that her golden age is perceived to be more in the future than in the past .\nOne of the purely technical influences on this is the significant role that Uranian ruled computers have played in advancing many of our studies and research practices .\nCalled \u2018 mathematicians \u2019 in Greece , the astrologers of ancient times had to be scientists and astronomers as constructing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThey would certainly have given anything to gain access to our fabulous Software , with its ability in a few clicks to compute and display with incredible precision planetary positions over thousands of years !\nNowadays , with disconcerting ease , we attempt to establish the maps of the heaven of the Buddha , Lao Tzu , or Pythagoras , all born around the great conjunction of Uranus , Neptune , and Pluto in 578-575 B.C.\n, which seems very much related to the \u2018 Axial Age \u2019 [ 1 ] .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ celestial configurations that presided over crucial historical events , perhaps to thereby infer what tomorrow will be like .\nAnyone , be they a politician , movie star , historical figure , neighbor or family member is a potential subject of study , once their natal coordinates are known .\nThis computational facility finally allows everyone to know his or her astral chart , which was rarely the case before , a fact that will prove essential when we examine the concept of identity that astrology offers .\nIn addition to technology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of astrology is that knowledge is spreading like never before : schools , associations and international organizations are blooming , treaties number in the hundreds and excellent translations of ancient texts , considered as rare treasures until recently , have become easily accessible .\nEven more importantly , astrology feeds on the revolution of ideas germinating everywhere .\nIts Uranian nature marries perfectly with the often referenced new paradigm , which puts consciousness at the center of our grids of interpretation of the universe and life .\nScience , philosophy and psychology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defined as intrusions of meaning into our relationships and destinies : some of the answers provided by astrology are quite astounding [ 2 ] .\nQuantum physics leads to the perception of space , time , matter , and energy as vast networks of vibrations and information in which all the different elements are in contact and where the observer is no longer separated from the thing observed .\nIt means that the physical distance between the stars and us is not a barrier to our psychic link with them anymore , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypotheses about vibratory , magnetic or gravitational influences that were never formally discovered .\nIn a world where scientists think that 85 percent of the mass of the universe is composed of a mysterious and undetectable dark matter , and whose cosmogonic conceptions are sometimes strangely close to Brahmanism [ 3 ] , the hypothesis of a human consciousness analogously structured by an inner solar system is perfectly viable .\nAlso feasible is the idea that if the whole psyche is probably not physically influenced by the stars , it is possibly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the manifestation of a celestial geometry that structures it , orients it and impregnates it with meaning and finality .\nSuch intellectual , philosophical , and spiritual effervescence , drawn from the most recent scientific trends , offers astrology its chance .\nWe are in dire need of new thinking patterns able to shake our consciousness to its roots : ideas can start like a raging wildfire and engulf the world with a snap of a finger .", "author": "viktorsimon19830206@gmail.com", "url": "https://cosmicintelligenceagency.com/astrology-collective-consciousness/", "published":

) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get your priorities straight .\nNormally your sign needs to acclimatize before making change , but this Mercury/Jupiter transit loans you a duck to water feel .\nWhat is emerging now , grows on you quite naturally .\nOctober 6 delivers a punched up new moon in Libra .\nDrawing extra turbo from Mars in Libra and the end of Pluto retrograde , watch for a relationship matter , contract , or work-related issue to hit full steam ahead .\nThe days that follow keep the action going strong , especially through October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retrograde , these few days could thrust you into added expense , more investment or involvement .\nOctober 9 can set you onto a next phase or stage .\nSaturn ends retrograde on October 10 , Jupiter ends retrograde on October 17 , and Mercury retrograde ends on October 18 .\nAll three aim to clear what \u2019 s been standing in your way .\nThey set the backdrop for the full moon in Aries on October 20 .\nWatch for something to fire up or flare up .\nMars/Pluto reach a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon action to keep packing a punch over the next day or so .\nIt could be the breakthrough you have been aiming for .\nIf it is something difficult , it was likely inevitable and if you are honest with yourself , you knew you were going to have to face it at some point .\nThere can still be uncertainty or unresolved pieces to contend with , but overall , the last week of the month is great for forging ahead .\nMercury retrograde is in effect to October 18 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on hold much .\nThere \u2019 s plenty of forward-moving action from the stars this month .\nThe month ahead finds you consumed with matters of heart and of wallet .\nWhile those two categories are top of the checklist most of the time , they are now more so than usual .\nThis is due to planets transiting in the sign of Libra , namely the sun , Mars ( to October 30 ) and Mercury , which continues in retrograde motion to October 18 .\nMercury retrograde is good for introspection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quality time devoted to creative endeavours , spruce up projects , loved ones , and to your personal happiness is also time well spent .\nVenus in Scorpio ( to October 6 ) keeps you nicely focused on the task at hand ( working smarter not harder is another item on the check list ) .\nLibra planets are increasing your observational skills .\nOthers can serve as a mirror to reflect upon .\nOctober 6 to 10 can put you/it in drive in some significant way .\nThe new moon in Libra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turbo from Mars , Mercury retrograde , and Pluto stationing direct ( ending a 5-month retrograde cycle ) .\nWhen a planet changes course , from retrograde to direct or vice versa , there can be a pause before go .\nThree planets change direction within days of each other : Pluto ends retrograde on October 6 , Ceres turns retrograde on October 8 , and Saturn ends retrograde on October 10 .\nAdditionally , Venus treks into Sagittarius and the sun teams up with Mars on October 7 .\nOctober 9 marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That \u2019 s when Mercury retrograde conjuncts the sun and launches into a next phase .\nMercury retrograde is also conjunct Mars on this same day .\nIt is not the time to skirt around it but to tackle it head on .\nIt is a good day for getting outdoors , for physical activity , spontaneous choices , and shopping excursions .\nJupiter ends retrograde on October 17 .\nMercury ends retrograde on October 18 .\nBoth precede the full moon in Aries on October 20 .\nPluto , a driving force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also exerts its influence on the full moon , Mars too .\nThe sun \u2019 s entrance into Scorpio on October 22 is accompanied by Mercury in full swing ( trine Ceres ) .\nDespite some uncertainty ( Venus square Neptune on October 26 ) and some continuing pressure ( sun square Saturn on October 30 ) the whole month is designed to get you up and rolling as you need to and want to be .\nMercury trine Jupiter on October 31 ends the month on the upswing .\nWhat if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be on your mind more than usual while Mercury retrograde continues ( to October 18 ) .\nThe month opens with push comes to shove or added cost ( emotional or financial ) as Mercury retrograde squares Pluto .\nWhether you face it by force or by choice , once over the hump , you are onto smoother sailing .\nIn fact , October 3 , 4 hold good prospect and can set you onto an opportunity upswing .\nThings can fall into place readily and well .\nThe whole month ahead is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for getting it off the ground and up and running .\nBoth the new moon in Libra ( October 6 ) and the full moon in Aries ( October 20 ) hold extra punch .\nThe new moon is accompanied by Mars in Libra ( conjunction ) and by Pluto ending its five-month retrograde .\nThis new moon is a \u201c call to action \u201d mandate .\nIt is especially propelling for those born on or near July 8 .\nIt calls for courage and creative enterprise .\nNothing ventured , nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be gained .\nLook to Venus in Sagittarius , starting October 7 , to set bigger wheels in motion .\nMercury reaches the midpoint peak of its retrograde cycle on October 9 .\nIn conjunction with the sun and Mars , this date marks the start of a next phase , for what is already in the works and also for new initiatives .\nGo to bat for yourself .\nDon your best fighting spirit and watch the good it does for you .\nOf course , it is important to respond rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about you , not to let yourself get triggered by raw or impetuous emotions .\nA hothead approach does not serve anyone \u2019 s better interests .\nMars and Mercury in Libra call for diplomacy , and for the weighing of pros and cons .\nUse your smarts , play it wise .\nConsider potential costs , repercussions , or the domino effect before putting all your eggs in the basket .\nAlso in the stellar line up are two more significant contributors .\nCeres , stationing retrograde on October 8 can uncover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redirect the conversation , plan , thinking , or trend .\nSaturn , ending retrograde on October 10 , can remove a block or holdup , shifts a mindset .\nThat \u2019 s a lot of planetary track switches over a few short days .\nPlay it moment by moment .\nOver the week that follows , you could find yourself on a positive move along .\nSome things can smooth out and/or fall into place better than you anticipate .\nJupiter ends retrograde on October 17 .\nMercury ends retrograde on October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d transits .\nThey gain extra fuel from Sun/Pluto ( square ) and Mars/Jupiter ( trine ) and set the stage for a particularly intense full moon in Aries on October 20 ( and 21 ) .\nThis full moon could be hard hitting , especially for those born on or near July 22 .\nThroughout the month , for each tough-go transit , there \u2019 s an ease-up or opportunity transit that follows .\nThe sun in Scorpio , starting October 22 , Mars in Scorpio , starting October 30 and Mercury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 31 should help you to reach higher ground .\nAlthough Mercury retrograde continues to October 18 , don \u2019 t let it stop you from trying on something or someone new .\nAn instant rapport or taking to it like a duck to water is a clue to destiny in the making and/or a karmic recall .\nAlready into it/into them ?\nThe transits for the month ahead are going to fill in a lot more of the picture for you .\nWhat sets into play has strong vitality .\nOnce the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the limit or the resistance surpassed , it \u2019 s full swing , go the distance time .\nFive planets change direction

October 17 .\nMercury ends retrograde , October 18 .\nAs if that isn \u2019 t enough to pick you up and move you , know that Pluto and Mars accompany both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the full moon in

worthy of your time , attention , and wallet .\nIt \u2019 s a good idea to cut back on the extras or the marginal , and to reprioritize .\nThe last week of the month has its ups and downs but Mercury

life is replete with moments of utter crystal clear clarity and times of downright confusion and bewilderment as you arrive at a crossroads , in the midst of a fog only to discover the Ireland of old \u2013 no sign posts and no hint of help as to which path is the one that will lead you what you believe SHOULD be your destination .\nThe primordial search for the fine and delicate fulcrum between instinct and analysis , fear and confidence , speaking out or remaining silent , patience or action has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u2022 None exercise your voice , stand up for what you truly belief and speak out against the evil that grips the Earth ?\n\u2022 None speak forth your seldom articulated true thoughts ( due to the fear of rejection ) ?\n\u2022 None express those thoughts that dominate your unlived life \u2013 that life lived within your head ?\n\u2022 None stop letting fate carry you along by seeing through the demons in your head so that you can veer back onto the path of authentic living ?\nThe search for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left your mind reeling as you have toyed with those seemingly paradoxical twins \u2013 clarity and confusion .\nYou know that you are not supposed to have an attachment to clarity , nor an aversion to confusion .\nBoth , after all , are one and the same ( in essence ) !\n\u201c But \u201d , I hear you say !\nYes , I know you live in the \u2018 real \u2019 world and you are dealing with \u2018 real \u2019 issues and a decision HAS to be made .\nYes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , there is much to be gained by having no attachment to the outcome of a decision .\nYes , the journey is more important than the destination .\nBut , everything within our current system of being points to the preference of clarity and conviction and the denial of the highly creative and at times humbling process of embracing the swirling mists of confusion .\nCan you really be sure that clarity is the right path ?\nThat pleasure is preferable to pain ?\nThat clinging to life and cheating death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day is better than night ?\nA path walked exclusive of the other means that you will eventually attract an event , a person and circumstance into your life so that you embrace the dualism of any of your choices .\nPeace and joy is found in the middle ground , a lesson that is the quintessential expression of the zodiacal sign of Cardinal Air , better known as Libra .\nBeneath the veneer of the ever present Duchene smile , the diplomacy , the royal \u201c We \u201d and the professional peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underlying the Cardinal Air consciousness filter , is to choose the way that leads between the two great lines of force \u2013 matter and spirit .\nIt is here that the correlation of balance and Libra arises .\nWhen mentioning the concept of balance , I am not referring to a juggling act , one in which simultaneously I keep all my projects going and all my relationships healthy , achieved through organisation , prioritisation and willpower .\nFor me , the spiritual significance of balance has more to do with Temperance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hermit and theologian , St. Ignatius , spoke of people being ruled by desire rather than being free to make conscious choices .\nWhen you are feeling pushed , desperate , reactive or highly emotionally charged , without having engaged in deep contemplation to prepare your soul for the path/ choices ahead , you are likely to make decisions that enslave you to those vanities and enemies of your Mind and Soul that trap you and bind you to your ego .\nWhen you are able to observe those emotions but breathe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without being enflamed by desire , fear or expectation , then temperance flows through your veins and you have experienced the deeper dimension of the Libran archetype .\nTo be temperate means that you honour and acknowledge your desires and passions but you do not constantly rearrange your life according to the ongoing flux of those highly charged states !\nTemperance does not restrain ; it guides us to be peaceful with what is , to discern what we are called to improve or to overlook , to have serenity of spirit no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation we find ourselves in .\nIt calls us to contemplation and then to action .\nNot action based on expectations of others , not perfect action as we see it , but doing what we can do , at the moment and in the circumstances .\nTo develop and sustain a spiritual focus in our lives , while living in our ever increasingly busy society , this is the challenge as busyness is forced upon us .\nBut you are the one who decides how the expectations of the outside world manifest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that can choose to centre yourself in the calm space between possibility and manifestation ; between rest and action ; between process and results .\nSri Kaleshwar says that you can find that place since \u201c all human activity is a search for a balance between survival and happiness .\nThis is the same as saying that all human activity is a search for a balance between the logical mind and the soul .\nTo live in balance , to both survive and be happy , you must have both logic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems you can have only one but not both .\nThe world tells us to reject the soul .\nSpirituality tells us to reject the mind .\nWe condemn the world for ignoring the soul , but conventional spirituality is equally guilty when it tells us to ignore the logical world .\nWhen you do this you are cut off from your world of daily life .\nThe dirty secret of conventional spirituality is that if an \u201d enlightened \u201d person wants to live in the ordinary world they must first undertake a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logical mind they left behind in their search for the soul .\nThey need to find some way for the logical mind to co-exist with the intuitive soul that now runs their lives .\nUntil they achieve this integration they are paralysed and isolated from the totality of what makes them human .\nSuch a handicap is why the spiritual path has been confined to renunciants who do not have to integrate with the world .\nIt is why the saints have not changed the world \u201d .\nIn other words once you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it back into the world with you , you can consciously infuse gOd like awareness into your daily life .\nBalance , therefore , is a combination of both action and the ability to remain poised as you act dynamically .\nWhen inspiration and expression , spirit and matter , creative and scientific thinking , idealism and practicality are balanced within you , the Cardinal Air energy is doing its work within your nature .\nLife is like riding a bicycle .\nTo keep your balance you must keep moving .\nAs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Libra on the 6th of October , you are given the opportunity to observe how clear you have been in being at one with your wOrd .\nThe existence of Libra within you means that you have the ability to speak forth and to breathe your mind into the world .\nWithin this dimension of your experience of life you can temper your choices , considering the well-being and perspective of those you are dealing with , yet at the same time sticking to your truth and ideals .\nThis New Moon affords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to speak forth your truth , even if you feel uncomfortable .\nSo I would offer the following questions as a meditation in the days leading up to the re-birth of the Cardinal Air consciousness within you \u2013 Have you conceded too much ground in your decisions ?\nHave you allowed the external world influence your thought process ?\nHave you allowed fear and security seize your heart and dictate your path ?\nHave you stuck to your principles too rigidly and therefore prevented the soft illuminating light of perspective from showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend sufficient time facing down the enemies of your Mind and forgiven yourself for the anxieties and worries that have coursed through your veins ?\nFinally , have you taken the time to rediscover temperance and fully embrace serenity ?\nMy best wishes to you during this profound shift in your consciousness .", "author": "AGENT EI - ANDREW SMITH", "url":

something that has changed them in a way that they could never go back to being the person they once were \u201d ~ Leonardo Decaprio ( Scorpio Sun ) Astronomically measured , this Full Taurus Moon is the longest Partial Lunar Eclipse for five hundred years , since 1451 according to space-time web-info ; and there isn \u2019 t another as long until 2650 .\nIn a thousand years of eclipses , \u2018 partial \u2019 is the key word here .\nA Partial Eclipse isn \u2019 t such a big deal as a Total Lunar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there \u2019 moment , as Moonlight is only slightly dimmed by Earth Shadow many will not even notice when it takes place over the America \u2019 s , Asia and Eastern Europe .\nThey could feel it , however .\nBecause Partial doesn \u2019 t mean any of the usual geophysical , emotional , intellectual and tidal shifts won \u2019 t happen during and around this eclipse , such as earthquakes and floods , as they surely will .\nThis Full Taurus Moon also reflects the light of an intense Scorpio Sun in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing challenges of intimacy and shared interests into direct focus .\nSpirit Sun has stealthy back-up with a concentrated celestial spotlight shining a light on difficult subjects .\nSecret weapons ( i.e.\n, feminine wiles ) , psychological nerve , crypto-coin-cracking conundrums , and mega-psychic connections are all potentially fruitful activity for the wise and brave .\nNote that any effects from events and situations around this Full Moon last longer than the usual six-week eclipse seasonal period ( which happens twice a year ) .\nDue to the Moon being furthest away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moon Partial Lunar Eclipse will last 6 hours and 2 minutes , meaning its influence will also endure .\nThis almost leisurely eclipse could suit those born under the steady sign of the Bull .\nIt \u2019 s well-known in astrological circles how Taurus likes to deliberate and take time in all aspects of life , so a longer timeframe could be rather agreeable for those who enjoy find the current pace of change tricky and prefer a slower pace to enjoy and carefully chew things over .\n( Patience , Aries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2022 ! )\nIndeed , this is a scintillating and sexy Scorpio-Taurus Full Moon alignment to savour .\nA 6-month marker is advised to see how settled and secure situations may be from here on : look forward to May 22 \u2019 s Full Moon Total Lunar Eclipse , when the entire Moon will reflect Earthshine and there will be no missing an exact bullseye as the time will be ripe for fully understanding the current karma driving passion and desire .\n\u2606 Staying within our 1200-year Sun-Moon-Earth connection , it is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years to see if anything resonates with where we are now , as this Lunar Eclipse is similar to that of November 3rd , 2000 .\nHighlighting all that can be applied and learned about the alignment of 26-28\u00ba Scorpio-Taurus within our own horoscope , note how major transformation comes with focus and determination .\n\u2606 A Full Moon in Taurus generally accents earthy stability , love and money , food , fruit and flowers , fine wine and raw , dark chocolate if we are lucky .\nThe sensitive Moon is happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nYet even though this eclipse takes place while the Moon in the best possible sign for Luna to be , strong and determined Taurus , the destiny-fulfilling North Node still lingers in Gemini , the sign of enquiry and communication , 1st grade school and gossip .\nThe karmic portal , i.e.\n, the Moon \u2019 s nodal axis , the Dragon \u2019 s Head only \u2018 truly \u2019 shifts into Taurus by the middle of January .\nSo instead of a holiday season fretting about shopping sprees or twinkling garlands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information gathering and a challenging mind-training that requires truth as the starting point of any think-tank .\n\u2606 The exalted Moon in Taurus is also conjunct Fixed Star , \u2018 Algol \u2019 , which enhances female sexuality , the creative Shakti-Power , with an all-consuming passion that can even activate the third eye , the perceptive forehead chakra that allows one to see beyond the three times .\nWe often fear this wild woman wisdom energy .\nUse this dynamic force consciously .\nAnything or anyone that has been repressed could now dangerously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned !\n\u2606 Full Moon Lunar Aspects ( that can help emotionally temper thoughts , words and actions ) : 1 ) A separating sextile from the Moon to Neptune indicates greater emotional ease .\nAt the same time , the Sun lessens its \u2019 Trine aspect to oceanic Neptune , so there may be less fantasy and more lucid dreaming .\n2 ) A separating square still holds a tight \u2018 Fixed T-Square \u2019 with Jupiter providing clarity and \u2018 ah-ha \u2019 moments in the grand experiment of \u2018 life , death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is currently going over old ground .\nSituations that surfaced last April to mid-May could resurface and , if too big and cumbersome , blow apart .\nIn such case we may need to revise , re-vision and re-present before Jupiter changes signs late December .\nLife is still sprinkled with hearty amounts of chop and change until the end of the year .\nBut at least Taurus can see a holiday on the horizon .\nAnd no , I am not insinuating Taurus lazy , this is the year of hard-working Metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just need to rest .\n3 ) Compounding the daunting nature of Scorpionic taboos ( intimacy , death , taxes and investments ) is a separating Trine from the Moon to Scorpio-ruled Pluto .\nTogether with the Scorpio Sun \u2019 s sextile to Pluto , situations that involve force or control solicit extreme action and reaction .\nThere are rarely half-measures with Pluto or Scorpio .\nWatch out for sowing seeds of division .\nOur task is not necessarily to stubbornly hold on to our personal point of view until changes are forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lash out the infamous Scorpio scimitar tail in frustration with those who don \u2019 t say or do what we think they should , but to let go of all that no longer serves the higher good of the whole \u2013 and watch out for the bamboozle .\nPoker-faced Mars in Scorpio is driving this horoscope .\nMars is the Sun \u2019 s confederate and at home in Scorpio .\nMars here is surreptitiously assertive : stay alert for sharp practice and , if needs be , keep certain cards close to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would seem , are best hidden \u2013 if only to protect the feelings of others .\nInsightful and furtive , forceful Scorpio Mars is still in opposition to the liberating and visionary Uranus in Taurus .\nA proliferation of eco-earth-memes and secretive shareware could test our sense of security and constancy , as we confront traditional Saturn and shake-up free-thinking Aquarius with the last challenging square between Saturn and Uranus on Xmas Eve .\n4 ) The next applying aspect the Moon makes is to Saturn .\nApplying aspects are generally stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long term care ; and try not to leave anyone feeling abandoned or left out .\nAs we have heard many times this past year from the media , but maybe not in the same words : we are all travelling on spaceship Earth together .\nBe kind to fellow passengers .\nEveryone has a story they carry with them .\n\u2606 Bringing love to the fore is planet Venus ; the heavenly ruler of the exalted Taurus Moon , Venus , is currently riding high in the night sky .\nVenus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next month \u2019 s Solstice Full Moon , December 19th ( an important date for your diary ! )\n.\nThe bright Lady of Love ( & war ) is therefore now in her shadow period , applying to the Solstice retrograde ; then taking until the end of February to come out of a long learning curve that has astral currents relating to January 2020 and Xmas \u2019 21 , as well as Solstice 2013 .\nLove often comes late when Venus is in Capricorn , where the lesson is that love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nYet when love finds Venus in Capricorn , we can also find staying power .\nWith this retrograde Venus reminds us to love what works for us whatever that may be , age differences and five-genders aside , love is a verb , it is what we do , be that our actual profession , or relating in long-lasting commitments , or even the importance of laying boundaries in relationship so that responsibilities are respected , Venus in Capricorn inherently understands that only love conquers fear and that love is the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish you all a blessed eclipse , until next moonth , with Love & Light \u2018 I don \u2019 t do great things .\nI do small things with great love.\n\u2019 ~ Mother Teresa ( Moon in Taurus )", "author": "AGENT 87 DAKINI \u2013 LAURA BOOMER-TRENT", "url":

Pisces ends its five-month retrograde tour on December 1 .\nA subtle tune-in influence , by retrograde , Neptune is an individualizing search-light transit , by direct motion it will source from the

participate/contribute to the mass consciousness too .\nNow that Neptune has completed its retrograde tour , it declares that the past five months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will now incorporate/weave that information into its script writing software program , in other words to the designing of reality , of where we take it from here .\nDecember 3 ( or December 4 depending on your location ) delivers a total solar eclipse in Sagittarius .\nIt is also a super new moon , which means it is a high tide time .\nThis one is a king tide .\nHere in my hometown , we are looking forward to the king tide to assist with a stuck barge .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ how high the average tide will be in the future , which is of significance to those who live near the shoreline .\nAn eclipse is an acceleration catalyst .\nIt will often produce something unexpected .\nThe super new moon , total solar eclipse in Sagittarius can produce a springboard or big jump/leap effect .\nSomething ends , something begins .\nA trend setting influence , it can be a stimulant for the markets and for speculative undertakings .\nMercury in Sagittarius is a significant contributor to the eclipse .\nAs such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcement , weather or an event of note , or for someone of significance to set wheels in motion .\n( Royalty and prominent individuals can make headlines . )\nThe Sagittarius eclipse can feature matters to do with education , publishing and broadcasting , legal undertakings , spectator sports , immigration , migration , religion , and spirituality .\n( Canada is waiting for the pope to visit and offer his apology to indigenous people for the Catholic church \u2019 s residential school crimes . )\nThis eclipse will be a significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct contact to your chart .\nOtherwise , you will witness the influence as a general intensity dial up .\nAt the very least , the eclipse puts everything to do with the holidays ( shopping , travel , etc . )\ninto full swing .\nAs of December 13 , Mars leaves Scorpio and begins its six-week tour of Sagittarius .\nOn this same day , Mercury leaves Sagittarius to begin a three-week stint through Capricorn .\nTogether they create a

over with .\nThe sun , Mercury and the Sagittarius eclipse keeps the searchlight on the future and for better days ahead .\nDecember 18 to 21 hosts a run of planetary activity .\nDecember 18 delivers a full moon in Gemini .\nDecember 19 , Chiron in Aries ends retrograde , and Venus in Capricorn begins retrograde .\nDecember 21 , the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Put that all together , and it is time to switch track from the outer-world hustle or concerns , and to reward yourself and loved ones in whatever way entertains , comforts , or delights you , that gifts you best .\nOn December 23 , Saturn in Aquarius will square Uranus in Taurus for last of three meetings .\nThis \u201c bust up the concrete , travel with the breaks on \u201d transit has been a dominant influence all year .\nIt has been mostly destabilizing and disruptive , but it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visionary change .\nThe more the air clears ( along with the clearing of the airwaves/thought patterns of the collective consciousness ) , the better we will be able to see it and seize it .\nVenus began its tour of Capricorn on November 6 .\nIt is usually a three-week transit , but due to its retrograde cycle , December 19 to January 29 , Venus will tenant Capricorn to March 5 .\nThis is a very long Venus transit !\nIf it works well for you , you \u2019 ll feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an advantage to be put to good use .\nThe shape of reality \u2013 Venus in Capricorn marks the time as right or ripe .\nIf you invest well , the transit sets you up to reap a significant reward .\nOn the realism side , we must appreciate that there is work to be done to build it better , to get it under better control , or to reap the respect and reward that is due .\nSlow , steady , and substantial is the Capricorn way .\nCapricorn is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and benefits .\nCapricorn is also the archetype of inner judgements and crystalized patterns of behaviour .\nVenus retrograde in Capricorn ( December 19 to January 29 ) is a time to re-examine

quality time with loved ones ( self included ! )\n?\nThe retrograde cycle is best used to reassess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also the Venus in Capricorn way .\nVenus retrograde puts fated circumstances and

past lives , to rework it and to move it to higher ground .\nThe potency of this Venus retrograde cycle should not be under-rated .\nVenus works closely with Pluto , agent of the soul .\nTheir focus ?\nEffective and lasting change ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as is mandated by the soul ( yours , ours ; \u2013 the mandate of Divine Soul too ) .\nVenus meets with Pluto three times : December 11 , December 25 , and March 3 .\nConsider these dates as marking the timetable for paving the foundation and/or for the cementing process .\nVenus retrograde conjunct Pluto on Christmas Day underscores the fact that reality has changed in a significant and lasting way .\nIt marks the holiday and the year end as an anniversary or milestone of note .\nKnow it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the end of what was and the beginning of what will be ; a long chapter ends while a new one is in its set up phase .\nWhy not observe the day with a new tradition ( Capricorn archetype ) .\nJupiter leaves Aquarius for Pisces on December 28 .\nJupiter in Pisces is ideal for going with the flow , for allowing yourself to feel inspired and hopeful again .\nThe total solar eclipse in Sagittarius on December 4 sets bigger wheels in motion .\nIt is fortuitous for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for reaching a wider audience ( i.e.\n, teaching , publishing , broadcasting ) , for educational or athletic pursuits , and for legal undertakings .\nGood news could come your way , visitors too .\nAt the very least , the eclipse puts the holiday season into full swing .\nYou stand to gain the most from this eclipse if you are born in the first five or so days of April .\nYou can feel a sense of fate or destiny in more obvious play .\nChiron in Aries ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOn December 23 ( 11:16 pm PST ) Saturn squares Uranus for third and

, and when they looked again he was gone , and they were left alone making legends of a Saviour .\nAnd the one carried in the current said , \u2018 I am no more Messiah than you .\nThe river delights to lift us free , if only we dare let go .\nOur true work is this voyage , this adventure.\n\u2019 And the creatures downstream , to whom he was a stranger , cried , \u2018 See a miracle !\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ flies !\nSee the Messiah , come to save us all !\n\u2019 Yet in time , as the creature refused to cling again , the current lifted him free from the bottom , and he was bruised and hurt no more .\nBut the one heeded them not , and taking a breath did let go , and at once was tumbled and smashed by the current across the rocks .\nThe other creatures laughed and said , \u2018 Fool !\nLet go , and that current you worship will throw you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you shall die quicker than boredom !\n\u2019 But one creature said at last , \u2018 I am tired of clinging .\nThough I can not see it with my eyes , I trust that the current knows where it is going .\nI shall let go , and let it take me where it will .\nClinging , I shall die of boredom.\n\u2019 Each creature in its own manner clung tightly to the twigs and rocks at the river bottom , for clinging was their way of life , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from birth .\nOnce there lived a village of creatures along the bottom of a great crystal river .\nThe current of the river swept silently over them all \u2013 young and old , rich and poor , good and evil , the current going its own way , knowing only its own crystal self .\nThis deep truth permeates every facet of your reality , as your environment , the world in which you reside , is a mirror of your attitudes , beliefs and expectations .\nIn other words , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the internal is echoes through the entirety of the external .\nThe drama within the world is the culmination of the consensus reality that we have chosen to believe in , and therefore create and perpetuate .\nIt feels solid and real , as the impeachable belief creates the illusion of that dream .\nBut it is important to understand , however , throughout time that consensus reality reaches a point wherein that reality no longer reflects the inner consciousness of individuals and therefore \u2018 glitches \u2019 , distorts and becomes \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that profoundly creative state , chaos , deepens , opening up pathways to create afresh .\nYes , it is that very Yin-state that many fear and fight , clinging to the twigs and rocks at the bottom of the river , unable to look in and down , so that they can truly see up and out .\nMany are so inert , so hopelessly fixated and dependent on the system , so deeply invested in maintaining this reality at all costs that they will fight to protect it by whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real ?\nIf you want the world to change , you first have to look down and in so that you can see the deeper currents above that will guide you through the maelstrom to conditions that better reflect those inner conditions .\nSpiritual teachers have talked about this throughout time .\nAnd through time , the energetic conditions periodically arise that enable more and more people to \u2018 awake \u2019 and to \u2018 see \u2019 , thereby altering the core of our consensus reality .\nWe are currently moving through such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the search begins and you can never go back .\nFrom then on , you are inflamed with a special longing that will never again let you linger in the lowlands of complacency and partial fulfilment .\nThe eternal makes you urgent .\nYou are loath to let compromise or the threat of danger hold you back from striving toward the summit of fulfilment.\n\u201d The most important step in changing your reality is to truly know yourself .\nTruly know .\nNot just what you like ; or dislike !\nNot the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut the chains that bind you fast ; the less conscious expressions of your scripts and patterns ; your dark ; your light ; and what you believe , that guidance system that opens up the channels of perception , altering the reality in which you \u2018 see \u2019 the world .\nWho are you ?\nWho are you behind the fa\u00e7ade of your personality ; behind your words ; behind your beliefs ; behind the role you have assumed ?\nWho are you in the darkened hours , when you rudely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rays of the morning twilight to rescue you from the labyrinth of your night ?\nWhat do you believe ?\nNot what you have learnt to believe or told is right ; nor in some higher deity or ideal or supposed \u2018 truth \u2019 .\nThose facades serve to imprison you within someone else \u2019 s opinion .\nLook inwards .\nBe honest with yourself .\nWhat lies in your heart that can not hide , that appeases your soul during time of forlorn sadness ; that awakens your eternal beauty and light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raise your spirit , spreading the warmth of joy through you , lighting the homing beacon that beams your flame through your eyes ?\nIf you believe in peace and love , when violence is directed towards you or if you witness unkind acts or when someone attacks you , do those images haunt your mind , inflaming your heart with righteousness indignation and zeal ?\nDo you allow such confrontation burrow into you for days or weeks afterwards ?\nDo you use the ammunition that has been discharged to hurt you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perverse sense of vindicated justice , further binding you and your mirror in a deeper karmic embrace ?\nOr do you liberate yourself from this potential incarceration by transmuting the hostility with sincere compassion , looking that person in the eye , offering them the gift of a heartfelt smile and inviting them for a cuppa and chat ?\nYou don \u2019 t have to join them in this dark place , but your genuine kindness can offer you both a key to unlock that prison door .\nThat is what awakening entails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chains that bind you fast .\nIt is the awareness that the reality of the outer world is merely a facsimile of that which is within you .\nIt is the deeper knowing of self and the cognizance that no one else has access to the world you carry around within yourself .\nYou are its custodian .\nYou are its gate keeper .\nYou are its carer and protector .\nNo one can truly see the world as you see it or feel it the way you feel it .\nAnd no-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless you give them your consent .\nThe message of Mutable Fire is a simple one \u2013 if you send out goodness from yourself , or if you share that which is happy or good within you , it will all come back to you .\nWhat you seek to share , you receive .\nLove knows no competition .\nLight has no boundaries .\nRighteousness , zealousness and fear have no place in Love .\nLove is unconditional , omnipresent and eternal .\nIt is utterly accepting , since it just IS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if you are hurting and angry , will be mirrored back to you from those who venture into your world .\nAnd this exchange is two way .\nWhat you receive is truly dependent upon what you believe in your heart .\nNot what you intellectually believe in .\nThe little creature in the river believed that his reality was not commensurate with his inner world .\nHe did not resonate with those around him anymore .\nHe had a core of deep faith within .\nThat faith enabled him to release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own world .\nHe looked in and down .\nHe saw up and out .\nHe let go .\nHis reality changed\u2026 Remember that your love , in turn , can soothe the pain and suffering in another , who may glimpse the key that has lain hidden within their own inner prison confines .\nIn turn Within this Mutable time , I implore you to look at the quality of the belief you hold in your heart , remembering that all faith and creativity is merely a hunger to cross over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afresh and building the conditions of a new world , within and without .\nThank you for spending time with me as you read the workings of my own beliefs .\nI am comforted that we are swimming together with the river current , even if there are few swimming in this direction .\nBe well as the redistribution of power intensifies in the coming weeks .", "author": "AGENT EI - ANDREW SMITH", "url": "https://cosmicintelligenceagency.com/sagittarius-eclipse-2021/", "published": "Wed, 01 Dec 2021

may you proceed with balance and stealth.\n\u201d ~ Patti Smith Can a poignant Solstice Full Moon be radiant and bright , and still be astronomically \u2018 micro \u2019 ?\nWell , yes , because Luna is currently the furthest away from Earth at the moment in her elliptical orbit , she is what \u2019 s known as \u2018 apogee \u2019 , or a \u2018 micro-moon \u2019 , the opposite of \u2018 super-moon \u2019 .\nBoth super and micro , nearest and furthest , can animate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nThough the super is more obvious , the effects of a micro-moon tend to creep up on us and catch us unaware .\nThis is therefore a \u2018 stealth \u2019 Full ( o ) Micro Moon with far-reaching , undulating waves that appear to have been around for quite some time and , indeed , may be so deeply embedded that a surge rarely fully peaks ( head \u2019 s up : April 12th \u2019 22 ) , but instead spirals along in a sweeping , fractalising , emotionally distant but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSuch a tidal pull , just as the Sun is about to come to stand-still ( Sol = sun , Stice = Still ) , can also slow one down when juggling the changes that invariably come about when both Sun and Moon combine the mighty Love-Wisdom of mutable signs , wise Sagittarius and versatile Gemini respectively .\n\u2606 Be patient .\nChange comes three days after Solstice , with the Christmas exchange of light between North and South .\nTry not to hurry or sleepwalk through opportunities that enable timely truths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith .\nWhile the escapist oblivion of a Solstice Sun and Full Moon in hard \u2018 T-Square \u2019 to nebulous and mystical Neptune is a separating aspect , and therefore the influence is waning , it still suggests there could be a temptation to blur the lines of truth , vision , or reality in the days before the Full Moon , especially as it is also Saturnalia .\nIt \u2019 s been noted how alcohol and drug consumption has dramatically increased since the pandemic .\nBe careful , some easily available mind-numbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are other ways to go beyond the pain of our everyday suffering .\n\u2606 Just by looking at the distance of the Moon to Earth , for instance , the bigger picture can inspire a sense of optimism and mind-expansion and a determination to live in truth and beauty .\nThis Gemini micro-Moon could also trigger an overwhelming desire to go that extra mile \u2013 and not just for oneself .\nChatty Gemini \u2019 s kind word , a gentle gesture or helping hand can be helpful and healing to others in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the playful and clever , tongue-twisters and party games .\nAnd with the Moon in an excellent and very tight \u2018 Trine \u2019 aspect to Jupiter , which is the 27\u00b0 Sagittarian Sun \u2019 s ruler , it indicates luck and ease could be on our side .\nIn your chart , check 27-28\u00b0 Air signs Aquarius , Libra , and Gemini , and see where fortune currently favours .\n\u2606 In the few days before Solstice , the Sun aligns with the Galactic Centre , the part of the sky around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This can only encourage the Sagittarian archer to aim far and direct his arrow towards the light , and hold the magic beam .\n\u2606 A few days after the Full Moon we welcome the natural pause in our Earthly orbit of the Sun , on Tuesday the 21st , as the emphasis of light heralds Sol \u2019 s longest day in the South , the \u2018 Great Yang \u2019 , a time for gathering friends and family and garnering creativity ; with the longest night in the North a period of \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the duvet to dream and stay warm .\n\u2606 For those who hang the \u2018 do not disturb \u2019 sign along with seasonal decorations , be aware that while rest is often necessary to recharge and realign at this time of year , communicative Mercury is this Full Moon \u2019 s ruler .\nAnd , wouldn \u2019 t you know it , for this the Solstice Moon chart , quicksilver Mercury is extra busy and somewhat bolshie .\nCurrently fortified , with long convoluted histories , to the intellectually astute Mercury-ruled Gemini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is working experimentally ; plus dynamic Mars charging ahead ( the latter , incidentally , continues to drive this planetary \u2018 locomotive \u2019 shape chart taking us away from past ( life ) belief , until the awakening Full Moon February 16th 2022 ) .\nThere \u2019 s a fiery fearlessness to this particularly brave , driven and ruthless Mercury , at 8\u00b0 Capricorn , able to articulate , recant , and express in a direct and wilful manner .\nThe astral tip for a harmonious holiday season is selective seating arrangements ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into division if we don \u2019 t all make an effort to be open and inclusive , no matter a person \u2019 s colour , race , sex , age , or even opinion .\n\u2606 Harmonious relationship is Venus \u2019 s domain \u2606 Venus Retrograde ~ > Conjunct Pluto Venus is the BIG STAR of this Full Moon .\nGoddess of peace , love and harmony , Venus currently rules just and fair laws , working contracts , and beautiful cuisine , decorations and manners .\nShe has recently been dazzling seductively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brilliant Venus stations to go retrograde , exactly as Luna culminates on a Solstice Full Moon .\nWhat a show stopper !\nVenus only comes to her \u2018 Still-Point \u2019 , in order to retrograde , five times in eight years , in which she traces a five-pointed Venus Star pentagram in the sky with a fascinating sky dance .\nIrresistible Venus coming to a halt bang-on the Micro Moon moment is timely poise , with the light of the purposeful Sun to help pin-point and illuminate how to express , reassess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationships , particularly those with colleagues and professional and working relationships , as well as those which are secret , those which/who share the same passion , and those that have stood , and will stand , the test of time , offering firm bonds and an unbreakable alliance \u2013 or not , as the case may be .\nIn earthy Capricorn , Venus can be as much a rock to rely on , or in the extreme have a harder heart , like the responsible boss married to the job .\nDevotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiation .\nVenus now has a chance to exercise her love and beauty to rework and repower Capricorn , the hard working sign of tradition and authority , discipline and responsibility .\nLove Goddess Venus goes into a symbolic \u2018 underworld \u2019 by the New Moon 2nd January , where we can no longer see her .\nShe then makes her inferior conjunction \u2018 Star Point \u2019 9th January .\nAll this shows how events around this this Solstice , leading to 2022 , can align heart mind and spirit and soul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the year of Water Tiger With Venus heading all the way back to 11\u00b0 Capricorn by the end of January , there could be lots of ( romantic ) coming and going .\nVenus retrograde we can revalue , reworks , reorganise , and renew and re-estabilish by building \u2013 or pruning if not annihilating \u2013 the boundaries , blocks and obstacles we have in trusted relationship , shared goals , and career , to see what is needed to be reinforced , or , indeed , what is not valued , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venus in Capricorn conjunct Pluto connects to both the highest pinnacle of hard-won respect , and the obsessive , deepest darkest paranoid jealousy spectrum of loving relations , ones that often require the renouncement of ego for love , all of which may be nothing short of an initiation into renewal when faced with the pain of releasing all that no longer serves the honourable path of love .\nThus , as Venus starts her forty-days and forty-night retrograde retreat , she is in an extra powerful position conjunct Pluto \u2013 just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will be at Xmas day ( ( ! )\nThe same day as the last Saturn/Uranus Square of the year where authority vs freedom has been a key issue ) , and another penultimate meeting March 3rd .\nWhenever Venus and Pluto are together , the transformational power of love is heightened and intense .\nKnow now that the love we have for all sentient beings , seen and unseen , changes the world .\nThe entire three/four-month period Venus is retrograde , including applying and separating shadow , is extended imho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venus/Pluto conjunction .\nVenus also conjunct Pluto in January 2020 , December 2020 ( think back now ) , and all the way back to December 2013 ; and will be also conjunct Pluto in Capricorn for a last time , January 1st 2023 .\n( After that Venus will meet Pluto in humanitarian Aquarius for the next twenty years ) .\nUse these dates to compare how you are with the practical charms of Venus in Capricorn ( we will talk more about Pluto in Aquarius another time ) .\nSuffice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means it is not always what you know but who you know .\nVenus in Capricorn conjunct Pluto can overcome the fear of commitment or partnership , and professionally schmooze and transform partnership into an organised but passionate and lasting affair that mellows and renews in time .\nAs Venus completes the Goddess \u2019 sacred rose heart mandala in the sign of the Sea-Goat , Capricorn , for another eight years , we could learn that loving our demons can also take time \u2013 and healing .\nNote the Moon will be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kisses the heroic Sun , January 9th , so symbolic of wise feminine healing wisdom and the devoted heart .\n\u2606 This holiday and the entrance into 2022 could therefore be relationship intense in more ways than one .\nThe Venus Star Point teaches that whatever challenges we have at work , in relationship , at home , school or wherever , the most important aspect of love is to love oneself and whatever we are doing ; not in a puffed-up , \u2018 I \u2019 m the dude \u2019 ( or \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though strutting that vibe does impress some ( Think Venus in Leo ) , but with Venus in Capricorn an acceptance of loving the self and/or one \u2019 s work takes time \u2013 and effort \u2013 to achieve the exceptional results we would like to see for ourselves , that only we are meant to see and do .\n\u2606 Interestingly , Mercury will go retrograde in January just before our next Full Moon , January 17th .\nThe heavenly messenger , trickster-healing-brother will retrograde back to the very same degree of Capricorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep meeting , at 25\u00b0 Capricorn .\nThus the cosmic Capricorn dance of the past few years continues to focus upon the renewal of business and resources , but with heart and fairness .\nWhatever transpires over holidays , there will be magic to make and much to discuss for weeks to come !\n\u2606 With that I \u2019 d like to wish you all a very Happy Solstice \u2013 and all the astral holy days that follow .\nBecause , after 87 Moon reports from me ( ! )\n, agent 87 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its mission accomplished for raising the cosmic love vibration of Spiritual Esoteric Astrology in this format with the fabulous C*I*A : after almost 7 years , another mission calls .\nIt \u2019 s been a joy and honour to write the Full Moonlunar transmission .\nThank you , lovely

\u201c why does astrology work ?\n\u201d .\nWe know it works , we see it working in our lives , in our clients lives and in the world around us in so many varied and profoundly interesting ways .\nYet it is hard to define exactly how or why it works , as not one single explanation will ever suffice .\nSomething that has helped enlighten my journey of astrological understanding , of why the patterns and cycles of the planets continue to coincide with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astrology as a dynamic fractal like system .\nThat once set off at birth , as a birth chart or as any radix chart a dynamic is carried forward , with its own unique formula and conditions , which then continues to unfurl and unfold as a never ending fractal like pattern of growth .\nFractals are described as never ending infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales .\nThey are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop .\nDriven by recursion , fractals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures of Chaos .\nGeometrically , they exist in between our familiar dimensions .\nFractal patterns are extremely familiar , since nature is full of fractals .\nFor instance : trees , rivers , coastlines , mountains , clouds , seashells , hurricanes , etc .\nAbstract fractals \u2013 such as the Mandelbrot Set \u2013 can be generated by a computer calculating a simple equation over and over .\n( 1 ) When viewing a fractal pattern , one can see that any part of the pattern can be recognisable within any scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to macro .\nAs an infinitely complex , recurring and repeating , dynamic system , astrology suits also these dynamics , of being \u201c fractal like \u201d in nature .\nIn both fractal dynamics and astrology , patterns are found within patterns , patterns and cycles are always reflected as part of a whole , or larger pattern and cycle .\nThe dynamics set off in a birth/radix chart continue to live and are activated , through the constant movements of the cosmos astrologers call planetary transits , these transits and cycles continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth .\nAs we engage with astrology we see familiar patterns constantly unfolding , yet always in a slightly different context , we see them unfold in a spiral dynamic and not a linear one , in an aspect of being the same or similar too , but never quite the same .\nThe connections continue as every time we pay conscious attention to the dynamics operating in any astrological chart , we are engaging in a feedback loop , we are constantly putting in , receiving and releasing more information , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSeen through an astrological lens we can see how the constant re-engagement with our astrology charts is the feedback loop which renews our astrological fractal pattern and sets off constantly revised and updated versions of the inherent pattern held within .\nIf we envision our astrology charts as alive and constantly vibrating , unfolding and growing like a fractal from any or every point , we can see that as we change , adjust , transform , grow , mature our fractal mandala does the same .\nIf you could just imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fractal , set off from the initial conditions , the formula which is your birth chart , a cosmic like fractal is set into motion .\nConsider your unique astrological mandala that will have its own formula and cosmic cycles attached to it .\nLike the music of the spheres , the fractal of our charts would be a delight to see , yet one we can just imagine working with for now .\nWhat would yours look like ?\nWhen would be the times that a new pattern emerges ?\nWe can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transits , progressions , eclipses or whatever other methods we may choose to use .\nIt becomes ever more alive and dynamic , the more we interact with it , the more we see its patterns , as we become more conscious of it and how it is works and what we put back into the feedback loop .\nEvery-time you make a conscious or unconscious connection to any part or point of your astrology chart , another spike in your fractal ignites .\nTo see our astrology charts as one continual living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of creation that was set for us before our physical birth , and one that will continue to unfold and evolve way into the future .\nAt once we can see that the pattern abides to a deterministic view , being we can \u2019 t change our initial formula or given pattern , yet with a fractal like view of the chart , and a conscious connection to the ongoing feedback loop , we can see a responsive and most co-creative side of astrology working , as the shifts and changes in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , understanding and self realisation !\nAs seekers of astrological wisdom we are often confronted by the bigger questions of \u201c why does astrology work ?\n\u201d .\nWe know it works , we see it working in our lives , in our clients lives and in the world around us in so many varied and profoundly interesting ways .\nYet it is hard to define

coincide with our lives , is the understanding of astrology as a dynamic fractal like system .\nThat once set off at birth , as a birth chart or as any radix chart a dynamic is carried forward , with its own unique formula and conditions , which then continues to unfurl and unfold as a never ending fractal like pattern of growth .\nFractals are described as never ending infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales .\nThey are created by repeating a simple process over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nDriven by recursion , fractals are images of dynamic systems \u2013 the pictures of Chaos .\nGeometrically , they exist in between our familiar dimensions .\nFractal patterns are extremely familiar , since nature is full of fractals .\nFor instance : trees , rivers , coastlines , mountains , clouds , seashells , hurricanes , etc .\nAbstract fractals \u2013 such as the Mandelbrot Set \u2013 can be generated by a computer calculating a simple equation over and over .\n( 1 ) When viewing a fractal pattern , one can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be recognisable within any scale of the pattern , from the micro to macro .\nAs an infinitely complex , recurring and repeating , dynamic system , astrology suits also these dynamics , of being \u201c fractal like \u201d in nature .\nIn both fractal dynamics and astrology , patterns are found within patterns , patterns and cycles are always reflected as part of a whole , or larger pattern and cycle .\nThe dynamics set off in a birth/radix chart continue to live and are activated , through the constant movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these transits and cycles continue to inform the initial conditions set at birth .\nAs we engage with astrology we see familiar patterns constantly unfolding , yet always in a slightly different context , we see them unfold in a spiral dynamic and not a linear one , in an aspect of being the same or similar too , but never quite the same .\nThe connections continue as every time we pay conscious attention to the dynamics operating in any astrological chart , we are engaging in a feedback loop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and releasing more information , that then continues to fuel the unfolding pattern .\nSeen through an astrological lens we can see how the constant re-engagement with our astrology charts is the feedback loop which renews our astrological fractal pattern and sets off constantly revised and updated versions of the inherent pattern held within .\nIf we envision our astrology charts as alive and constantly vibrating , unfolding and growing like a fractal from any or every point , we can see that as we change , adjust , transform , grow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIf you could just imagine , your astrology chart as a living fractal , set off from the initial conditions , the formula which is your birth chart , a cosmic like fractal is set into motion .\nConsider your unique astrological mandala that will have its own formula and cosmic cycles attached to it .\nLike the music of the spheres , the fractal of our charts would be a delight to see , yet one we can just imagine working with for now .\nWhat would yours look like ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ new pattern emerges ?\nWe can see it being sparked and ignited by transits , progressions , eclipses or whatever other methods we may choose to use .\nTHE VENUS CYCLE All planets create patterns around the earth in their cycles , yet

observances of a single \u2018 awakened \u2019 life , we reunite the ancient wisdoms with the newfound information of our reality and apply that integrated gnosis towards creating a better world , both individually and collectively .\nAwaken to the reality that you are the cosmic nexus of celestial consciousness and ultimately everything in the Universe is you !\nWhile you are reading this , I

.\nI would like you to let go of hard opinions and soften your boundaries as to what you suppose about this reality .\nJust be open to new connections of concepts that may not normally appear to

understandings .\nFor each of us , higher consciousness requires expansion into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you are the \u2018 center of the universe \u2019 .\nI would like to tap into the very essence of the elemental consciousness of nature and bring it into our complex consciousness of human awareness .\nLet \u2019 s take a new look at the micro-mezo-macro-cosmos at work .\nForget about any preconceived notions of what astrology is .\nTry to forget about \u2018 words \u2019 .\nFocus only on the potentials words could have\u2014for words also separate one thing from another .\nWords define boundaries , which keep us subjective , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boundlessness\u2014the objective unbounded self .\nFeel into the energy for the unified truth resonating behind the possibilities of these thoughts .\nAs an \u2018 ontological researcher \u2019 of the meta-sciences , I tend to venture down what would be to some people , rather terrifying roads of mathematical equations and hypothesis .\nI do this in order to peer into works of physicists , mathematicians and quantum theorists , and to observe what they have been up to over the last few years and decades .\nAs I am only somewhat inclined towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a task .\nWhat I am really about is a \u2018 pattern-ology \u2019 ; I have a knack for identifying nuanced patterns in number , nature and in behaviors , which is to some degree , a skill most astrologers must develop .\nMathematics could be described as a study in patterns .\nOne might also describe astrology this way .\nI believe that many of the missing links that are required to scientifically understand astrological influences have already been discovered , but are not yet fully appreciated in the larger framework @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no distinction between science and spirituality ; we only choose to make it so .\nThe ancient world viewed all spiritual studies as scientific , and all science as spiritual and sacred .\nMany breakthroughs , which have yet to be realized or assimilated by those of us in the metaphysical disciplines , have been made within the empirical sciences .\nWe , as astrologers , are just as guilty of excluding the relevance of the newly discovered mainstream scientific facts and tools from astrology as science has been to exclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe majority of both camps have chosen to remain separate in their own self-identified , self-focused worlds\u2026 and that has to change .\nAnd since we are the world-bridging wisdom holders , it is up to us to make the effort to change things .\nSome within the mundane scientific disciplines have begun to recognize what the ancient sages have always known , that ultimately everything is connected \u2013 we are literally one with all .\nWhat are you ?\n!\nThe Greek phrase gn\u014dthi seauton or temet nosce in Latin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times .\nMany astrologers use the ancient Delphic maxim ; \u2018 know thyself \u2019 as a way to emphasize horoscopic astrology as a personal practice .\nI would add , that the phrase is a directive for you to seek the awareness of what you truly are\u2014and that it is intentionally left open-ended .\nAlmost everyone begins their astrological studies through knowing their Sun sign and then their personal natal chart .\nThis gives us a much better understanding of what we consider as our self , and how that self relates to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the first step in taking that self knowledge outward beyond the human level of awareness .\nTo truly know One Self , one must go beyond a self .\nBut if we do share a common connection to everything and everything manifests from and returns to source , then what is self anyway ?\nWhere does \u2018 thyself \u2019 actually end ?\nOr does it ?\nAnd how does one begin to comprehend Self beyond self ?\nTo find out what celestial components we are made of in this particular life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say our self , within the \u2018 here and now \u2019 by plotting our position and path in space-time .\nThe personal natal chart is the tool by which one begins to truly know oneself .\nThis tool is made of symbols which describe natural forces and energies that coalesced at the time of your birth , and of which you are still essentially comprised , yet are always being affected by the processes of time .\nWe have observed and described these energies through their qualities , cycles and patterns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we use to interpret our internal makeup , our biology and our behaviours .\nYet , the energies which we are describing extend beyond self , beyond the planet , into the solar system through the galaxy and ultimately to the edge and center of the Universe itself\u2014simultaneously .\nThe resonant energy fields expressed by the planets and the Zodiac are our ingredients .\nThese cosmic energy frequencies are imprinted deeply throughout our genes and arranged within our very elements .\nWe emit our personal zodiacal radiation signature as we interact and react @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us .\nWe are bio-transceivers of frequencies , antennae for communicating spiritual energy .\nThese energy fields are a part of us , just as we are part of them .\n~ As without , so within .\nHow do we know ?\nAll of our senses recognize patterns .\nWe visually perceive our surroundings by recognizing color , depth , texture , etc .\nFor example , color is a spectral frequency , a pattern of light .\nDirect observation means seeing visual patterns , which are pervasive in nature .\nVisual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaotic , never quite exactly repeating , and involve fractalization on some level .\nPatterns with a beginning and an end must have deviation .\nNatural patterns stem from a centre axle creating spiralling wave forms of geometric points of intersection ; the places in space-time where those symmetries of rotation and reflection interact .\nAll patterns have a regular underlying mathematical structure ; indeed , mathematics as a whole can be described as the search for regularities .\nThe derivative of any function is a mathematical pattern .\nThat equation is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicate how each half of a reflective variable equates .\nThe recognition of the central balancing point between two entities of different domains is the fundamental purpose of math\u2014finding the center .\nThink in terms of energy , frequency and vibration .\n~Tesla .\nOur senses tend to cross over with their patterns , and in turn , how we perceive them .\nThis is called synesthesia or \u2019 union of the senses \u2019 .\nIn humans , tastes correspond to smells , and in some animals , scents become visualized .\nUltra- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , or touch , which directly affects the psyche ; like the soothing sound of a babbling brook or the hair-raising reaction to nails scratching a chalkboard .\nMany smells remind us of personal memories ; and some , such as high frequency essential oils have the ability to connect us to \u2018 preexisting memories \u2019 , ancient ones , beyond our self .\nThese are the patterns of various frequencies interacting with each other which stimulate awareness , because we are an assemblage of collaborative vibrations , as well .\nAstrology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sounds we are listening to are the parts being played within and around us , in our little section of the infinitely instrumented Cosmic Orchestra .\nYou as a person\u2014per-sona meaning \u2018 of sound \u2019 \u2014are a brief but powerfully resonate verse of a vast choral suite of the harmonizing movement of the grande cacophonic Universal Magnum Opus entitled , The Music of the Spheres .\nPut Yourself at the Center of the Equation In 1933 , British astrophysicist Arthur Milne gave his interpretation of the \u2018 cosmological principle \u2019 stating that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the expansion of the universe will always appear the same .\nAnd that makes you , and everything else , always the center of the universe .\nIf you go back to the beginning , at the centre of it ALL is Everything .\nThis Everything divides itself into two opposite forces , from which all qualities are fundamentally derived .\nEven before there is spacetime , the protopattern for what is to come already exists as part of an eternal expression .\nThe fundamental scheme of all natural shape and form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolves into the space created for creation .\nThe field of the fundamental pattern emerges from every point , this is what I refer to as the \u2019 cosmological simplex \u2019 , the blueprint , imprint , fingerprint and voiceprint of God .\nWe as astrologers call this root archetypal pattern around us , the Zodiac .\nFrom this simple order of duality , nature divines subtle reflective polarities of condition and behaviour .\nThis primordial template is expressed through countless opposing and variable qualities .\nIt morphs into and out of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yin curves intersecting with yang lines , of one dimension hyper-expanding into the next ; each one manifesting all the degrees of \u2018 male and female \u2019 union , or divine opposites , through energy and form .\nThis primary zodiacal pattern functions at every phase , scale and relative magnitude .\nIt constructs the energetic framework , the skeletal system of reality and also gives it the very energetic \u2018 flesh \u2019 from which everything arises .\nUpon this limitless scaffold , all manner of energetic form and function is devised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holographic phenomenon we call subjective existence .\nWe are woven into the very fabric of the divine quantum tapestry of this immeasurable interconnected self .\nThis \u2018 cosmological simplex \u2019 or \u2018 zodiac \u2019 pattern not only encompasses the Earth it wraps around all central fields of consciousness , be it particle , person or planet .\nIt is the energy around the nucleus of all points , no matter how small or how vast\u2014there is always the nexus .\nHeart of the Heart of the Heart The iron in your blood comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sun , a supermassive star at the very instant that it went supernova .\nYour physical heart is the central core of primary system that you call you .\nThe heart connects and interacts with every molecule of hemoglobin as each travels through the arteries , veins , and capillaries , through the heart and out again to every point in the body .\nAt the center of hemoglobin lies an even smaller molecule called a heme , which is a type of coordination complex , a geometric array of bound atoms surrounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of metal .\nIn the case of heme that metal is , of course , iron .\nEvery single atom of iron at the heart or every heme porphyrin is a core component of each molecule of hemoglobin which passes through your heart and was created in the heart of a dying star .\nThe creation and disbursement of many essential elements are somehow connected to various stages of the life and death processes of a sun .\nThe iron atom is only created under the same conditions , and at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it occurs in the same way within each supernova in the universe .\nIron is at the core of the frequency of the heart , no matter at what scale that heart is .\nIron is part of the composition of the processes of the heart , within molecules ,

Pisces isn \u2019 t a direct route .\nDuring the next eighteen months the Jupiter transit zigzags into Pisces , back to Aquarius , to Pisces into Aries , and back into Pisces Let us reflect on what Jupiter in Pisces means for you and the world .\nLike a cosmic Santa Claus , Jupiter has girth and represents qualities of gregarious generosity .\nNo other archetypal figure is known for its laugh , like Santa Claus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jupiter is ` Zeus \u2019 ; the king of the gods , larger than life , the ruler of the universe .\nJupiter gifts us with the humor , positivity , and optimism where it transits .\nJupiter \u2019 s meaning is built on the foundation of beliefs , philosophy , and benevolence .\nCritical to Jupiter \u2019 s character is truth , and like a good king , sovereignty .\nWhere you find your natal Jupiter , for example , is where you pursue you find freedom by expressing the truth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far the biggest planet in our solar system .\nJupiter is so large that over thirteen hundred earths could fit into the gas giant .\nTake an astrological cue from Jupiter \u2019 s size ; where it transits it expands .\nOf course , in practical applications big is not always better .\nMany a Jupiter transit has correlated with simply ` expansion \u2019 ; expansion of one \u2019 s waistline , expansion of one \u2019 s individual freedoms post-divorce , or the ultimate expansion of the soul which occurs at death .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ lend itself to largeness\u2014which is not always initially welcomed but ultimately for ` the best.\n\u2019 Since Jupiter is known as the great ` benefic \u2019 a Jupiter transit generally corresponds with a positive and uplifting result eventually .\nJupiter expresses its benevolence swimmingly well as it transits Pisces .\nAs one of the co-rulers of the sign of the Fish , Jupiter resonates with the Pisces traits of understanding through compassion , artistry through imagination , and transcendence through altered states of consciousness .\nPisces rules all things ` beyond reality \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reflections , spirituality , the numinous , symbolism , dreams , divinity , idealism , imagination , illusion .\nEven though ethereal Pisces represents beyond reality , ironically , it also embodies the ` all of life \u2019 .\nPisces is the quintessential water sign , necessary for all life .\nThe planetary ruler of

@ @ @ @ @ @ above it all \u2019 , soul , spirit , transcendence .\nJupiter \u2019 s transit through Pisces promises to magnify and enlarge the essence of the watery and mutable energy .\nAny shifts will only be hinted upon in 2021 .\nThat is because the ingress of Jupiter starting on May 13th will scarcely cover the first two degrees of Pisces before Jupiter shifts back into Aquarius on July 28th .\nJupiter won \u2019 t pick up speed until 2022 and , like a wave , crests with its expansive gifts on April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neptune .\nThat is when we collectively experience the blending of the two rulers of Pisces , in its home sign .\nAny Jupiter Neptune conjunction is a big deal ; it is a cycle that unfolds over a thirteen-year period , coloring a certain spiritual ethos because of the dual rulership in Pisces .\nWe are currently living through the waning phase of the Jupiter Neptune conjunction of 2009 which occurred in Aquarius .\nA Jupiter Neptune Cycle in Pisces is even more momentous because of its rarity , and because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe last time we collectively experienced a Jupiter Neptune conjunction in Pisces was in 1856 .\nThe late nineteenth century exploded with spiritual questing ; the transcendental movement , the beginnings of hypnosis , psychotherapy , Theosophy , the religion of Spiritualism , as well as the American Civil War predicated on human freedoms .\nWe might expect a similar explosion in spiritual yearning over the next twelve months .\nWhat might we expect as Jupiter emphasizes the Piscean qualities ?\nLooking backwards to anticipate the future illuminates .\nThe last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was the year when two news stories dominated : the devastating earthquake in Haiti , and the Wiki document dump by Julian Assange .\nThe world \u2019 s heart strings responded to the Haitian citizens with unprecedented compassion , a true Pisces trait .\nJupiter \u2019 s questing for truth correlates with that of the largest release of military documents ever\u2014over 400 \u2013 by independent journalist Assange .\nInterestingly , Julian Assange is now in the news on the eve of this next Jupiter in Pisces ingress , as there are increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9458509/Julian-Assange-supporters-demanding-release-hold-vigils-London-today.html ) Top movies in 2010 reflect the dominate Jupiter in Pisces themes , death , water , dreams and hypnosis .\nThe plot of the ` Hereafter \u2019 involves a psychic who provides solace to people by communicating with their dead loved ones .\nA character in the movie believes she had a near death experience while being trapped in a tsunami .\nThe ` Illusionist \u2019 is a movie about the very Pisces themed hypnotherapist , and the ` Inception \u2019
