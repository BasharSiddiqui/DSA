the Stewardship of Creation and resides in Bengaluru , India .\nHe received his M.Sc in Environmental Science from the University of East Anglia ( UEA ) , England .\nHis first hand experience of the

: Emails leaked from personal accounts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberately exaggerate the warming rate in the 20th century ) .\nHis subsequent journey in understanding the reality of the climatic system made him espouse the position of climate realism , a position that views climate in terms of the real-world climate measurements ( that shows no signs of dangerous increase ) and not through the lenses of faulty forecasts that predict a climate apocalypse .\nHe advocates for the use of fossil fuels in developing countries , the very same energy sources that lifted the Western society out of poverty in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ op-ed written for Climatism blog , Vijay illustrates the brazen hypocrisy of the climate-obsessed Western mainstream media , vilifying conservative leaders such as Australia \u2019 s PM Scott Morrison for supporting fossil fuels and coal , while remaining silent on \u2013 \u2018 green \u2019 energy darling of the Left \u2013 Angela Merkel \u2019 s ramping up of coal-fired power stations in order to negate the disastrous economic and environmental fallout from her countries disastrous 500 billion Euro ( failed ) Energiewende experiment .\nFrom a perspective of humanity , Vijay highlights the deadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuels in order to lift billions of people in developing countries out of abject poverty by allowing an estimated 1.3 billion of them to experience actual electricity .\nAccording to the Washington Post , \u201c around the world , 1.3 billion people lack access to electricity .\nMore than 600 million are in sub-Saharan Africa , and more than 300 million are in India alone.\n\u201d As well , Vijay recognises the undeniable need for advanced societies to maintain their use of cheap , reliable and clean fossil fuel technologies , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth , keep the lights on , as well to maintain environmental health .\nAfter all , the greatest threat to the environment is not affluence , it is poverty .\nThe border between Haiti and Dominican Republic , a fine example .\nSee : UN Carbon Regime Would Devastate Humanity And The Environment In 2020 alone , German Chancellor Angela Merkel approved the use of six supercritical HELE coal fire-powered stations in the country .\nAs a stage when the Paris agreement conveners are looking up to Germany to represent itself as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening up of coal plants comes across as a slap in the face of the agreement between Berlin and Paris .\nWhen a nation like Germany , touted as the global leader in \u2018 clean \u2019 energy , can open up new coal plants , why can \u2019 t economies like Australia do the same ?\nWhy are the left and the greenies branding Australia as a \u201c fossil badboy \u201d ?\nAre only leftists and developed European nations entitled to reliable and affordable power from fossil fuels ?\nGermany is a leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in the world .\nBut that status is under threat as the country \u2019 s political leadership is struggling with its obsession for \u201c clean \u201d energy and the increasing pressure to provide energy access at an affordable rate .\nThough being touted as the global leader in renewable energy , the country failed miserably in fulfilling its emission reduction targets during recent years and made headlines across the globe for its failure .\nDespite setting aside $ 580 billion in expenses to transform its energy systems away from fossil , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction targets .\nThis year , the country \u2019 s premier Merkel went a step further to upgrade her dismal record in keeping promises and embraced fossil fuels .\nUnable to meet the growing energy needs , she had no option but to approve the activation of six state-of-the-art HELE supercritical coal-fired power stations in Germany \u2019 s Datteln , L\u00fcnen , Hamburg , Stade , and Schkopau .\nSurprisingly , the chancellor did not go through the same treatment that some of her counterparts in other parts of the world are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast to the treatment Merkel enjoys in the global mainstream media , Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been the subject of ridicule for his open embrace of fossil fuels , especially coal .\nThe global mainstream media \u2019 s treatment of the Australian PM is nothing but blatant hypocrisy !\nWhile leaders like Angela Merkel are allowed to use fossils , those like Morrison are ridiculed for doing the same .\nIn fact , the hypocrisy becomes more intense when considers the total CO2 emissions from different countries so far !\nAustralia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6th .\nChina , who are currently being praised for their announcement of carbon neutrality target , stands number one in the ranking for total CO2 emissions .\nMake no mistake , CO2 emission is not a bad thing !\nBut the fact that the leftist \u2019 s mainstream media chose to blacklist few political leaders while allow others to run scot-free exposes their hypocrisy .\nMedia Morphing the Importance of Australian Coal as Evil Moreover , the leftists seldom care about the lives of millions in Asia who directly depend on Australian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China have abundant coal reserves , they still depend on Australian coal to meet domestic energy needs .\nIn addition to fueling their energy plants , Australian coal\u2014which is a cleaner form of black anthracite coal\u2014is the preferred fuel in their steel plants .\nAustralian coal production increase is partly induced by the soaring export demands from developing nations like India and China , and even developed economies like Japan .\nIn 2019 , Australia \u2019 s total coal export was valued at $ 64 billion , with Japan alone buying $ 17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal worth $ 13.7 billion and India $ 10.5 billion .\nIronically , the host of Paris agreement , France , took in $ 0.6 billion worth of coal from Australia in 2019 .\nIn fact , the energy sectors of these coal import countries are highly sensitive to disruptions in supply of Australian coal .\nThis was evident recently when a ban on import of Australian coal\u2014due to the on-going political tensions between China and Australia\u2014plunged thousands of homes into darkness in China .\nInstitute of Public Affairs in India estimates that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access electricity .\nIn a nation where hundreds of millions are yet to experience uninterrupted power supply , Australian coal supply could be vital .\nAnd it is not just the foreign economies that benefit from Australian coal .\nCoal is mined in every state in Australia and it is one of the country \u2019 s economic lifeline .\nIn 2019 , It was responsible for 56 % of the nation \u2019 s electricity requirements .\nEstimates indicate that the Australian economy has been strongly supported by 9,100 million tonnes of black coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal since the 1700s .\nMining and resources have been a key contributor to Australia \u2019 s economic growth , according to 2019 National Accounts data by the Australian Bureau of Statistics .\nInstead of broadcasting actual benefit of superior grade Australian coal in Asia Pacific , the liberal mainstream media has branded Australia \u2019 s coal sector as evil and cast Prime Minister Morrison as the villain in their anti-fossil propaganda drama .\nTo rub salt on the wound , they \u2019 ve cast climate hypocrites in Europe as climate saviors .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern\u2014to the climate alarmists\u2014then they must actually promote Australian coal and clean coal technology like the HELE supercritical coal technology that emit 30 percent less CO2 .\nRather , the failure of support for high grade Australian coal and the HELE technology has revealed the alarmist \u2019 s and left \u2019 s unwillingness to the rising cost of energy prices from renewables or the huge financial burden non-fossil technologies are having on the economies and the industries which act as their backbone .\nAuthor : Vijay Jayaraj is an

batteries that can store energy generated by renewables \u201d .\nNew Discoveries that Change \u201c Settled Science \u201d based Climate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center of the debate surrounding climate change .\nIn my book \u201c POLAR BEARS in the HOT TUB \u201d , I addressed the claims about how the global temperature change was impacting Polar Bears and what caused these changes in temperature .\nI explained that the rate at which CO2 was increasing depended on the hydrogen content of fossil fuels and further that there was no connection between CO2 concentration and temperature rise or energy use .\nIn this , the book \u2019 s sequel , I use five data sets to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in global temperatures since 1980 and the reason for subsequent cooling in recent years .\nThe sequel is based on five key data sets : 1 .\nA NOAA global temperature map ( 2013 ) showing warm and cool areas on the planet .\n2 .\nA NOAA global temperature map ( 2017 ) identifying alarming temperature \u201c Hot Spots \u201d at geographical locations , especially within the Arctic Circle .\n3 .\nA 2020 global temperature map showing the absence of most of those hot spots , especially Arctic areas .\n4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2020 , which shows that all of the global hot spots were located above deposits of uranium ore. 5 .\nHistorical data that shows low sun spot activity is correlated with mini-ice-ages and major sun spot activity correlates with warming global periods , thus connecting the uranium deposit activity to sunspot activity .\nThese five new perspectives must alter Global Energy Reports and Policies that have been against the use of fossil fuel .\nHere is why .\nDisappearance of Existing Hotspots : CO2 Not the Primary Driver of Temperatures The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most common faults that many climate scientists have been using : CO2 can not be the primary driver of global average temperatures .\nGlobal temperature maps ( for 2016 and 2020 ) are available from NOAA showing hot areas and colder areas .\nNote the absence of large red [ hot ] areas , and the many blue [ colder ] areas appearing in the latest [ 2020 ] map .\nThis cooling stands in stark contrast to the alarmist models \u2019 predictions , which predicted progressively warmer temperatures because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas concentration .\nThe irrefragable connection between Uranium Ore and Thermal Hot spots demonstrates that Uranium ore deposits are the Primary Driver of Global Warming .\nThe fifth set of data reveals groundbreaking insights into the totally ignored correlation between Uranium ore deposits and thermal hot spots in regions across the globe .\nA table showing the location and the amount of the top 10 of uranium ore deposits worldwide is given below .\nSurprisingly , each of the uranium ore deposits is located beneath a \u201c hot spot \u201d .\nThe data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been caused by the nuclear reactions in the uranium ore deposits , rather than the current popular theory that blames the Greenhouse Gas blankets .\nIt is also very important to note that hotspots have disappeared or cooled down considerably during the last 5 years .\nIf these hot spots continue to cool in the future , then the world temperatures will not increase .\nInstead we would witness a drop-in temperature .\nHowever , there is another critical correlation that determines the future of global average temperature : Sunspots .\nScientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice ages correlated with the absence of sunspots and the warmer periods in recent millennia correlated with an increase in sunspot activity .\nGraph of average yearly sunspot numbers showing the 11-year solar cycle .\nImage Credit and Source : Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica , Inc .\nThe increase in sunspot activity also correlated with the global warming that began in the 1980s .\nPrior to the 1980s , there was no major increase in temperatures despite 200 years of Industrialization and high atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide .\nSunspots are now at very low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed from the global temperature maps above .\nAccording to commentators , the next Cycle 25 is likely to be slightly smaller than Cycle 24 and much lower than the maximum annual sunspot number of 250 ) .\nGiven the non-correlation between CO2 and global temperatures , economies can now shift towards an energy policy that is more fossil friendly as other sources are developed .\nShutting down Nuclear and Coal plants , and installing more renewables and gas fired turbines will not benefit the world .\nRenewables , despite the global fanfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affordable electricity .\nNot having power for several days would be a devastating catastrophe .\nAt present , there are no cheap batteries or even a high-volume source of batteries that can store energy generated by renewables .\nThis requires operating gas turbines to negate the disruptions in renewable generation .\nIt also requires maintaining the supply chain of natural gas from gas well , through gas purification to remove sulphur , to compressors , to pipelines and to gas storage .\nMoreover , contrary to popular belief , this policy will continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse , increase the cost of power and everything else in society .\nAll efforts to reduce CO2 levels to save our planet are ineffective , costly and counterproductive .\nKeeping hydrocarbons in the ground or raising the cost of hydrocarbons will have serious consequences .\nFor example , there is no substitute source ( apart form Hydrocarbons ) for asphalt for roads , roofs , polyester for clothes , carpets , polyester fiber for tire sidewalls , graphite fiber for lightweight electric cars or for the more than 5000 other products that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All these are derived from hydrocarbons .\nCoal may not be KING but it can be a SAVIOR with no negative factors .\nCoal , with acid gases removed from the stack gas , provides reliable power from local fuel and also CO2 at ground level for increased production of food from land and sea .\nDeveloping economies , and even some developed economies , will experience immediate and adverse consequences if they shift away from hydrocarbons .\nThe most logical analysis reveals that CO2 and greenhouse gases are not the primary drivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these new findings on Uranium ore \u2019 s correlation with temperature hotspots , it is time policy makers and decision-making institutions pay attention to the simplicity of the climate system and stop restricting themselves to the narrow theory of fossil fuel driven

globally as \u2018 monstrosities \u2019 .\nHere is the letter from Windsor castle , dated 29 April 2018 : What a great question .\nAs we can see , Prince Philip , a Patron of the Royal Geographical Society admired the work and writing of geologist Ian Plimer .\nIn fact , the Prince attempted to invite Professor Plimer to London to address the Royal Society of Artists ( RSA ) on the topic of climate change .\nThat invitation was later rescinded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as was documented by James Delingpole in the UK Telegraph at the time .\nAs Delingpole wrote : Here \u2019 s part of the embarrassed kiss-off Prof Plimer received from the RSA \u2019 s chief executive : I am afraid I am writing to you with some disappointing news regarding the Prince Philip Annual Lecture on 5 May .\nAs you well

scrupulous in avoiding any appearance of advocating or supporting a particular political stance .\nThe RSA \u2019 s charitable status also requires us to maintain absolute political independence in our programme of events and research events .\nAfter discussion with Buckingham Palace , it is therefore with great regret that we must withdraw your invitation to give this year \u2019 s PrincePhilip Lecture .\nThe Duke of Edinburgh is personally disappointed as he read your book with great interest and was looking forward to hearing you speak , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now highly controversial debate surrounding this issue would make it inevitable that he was seen to be taking a particular position .\nWhat is extraordinary about that letter is that as well as confirming the Prince \u2019 s admiration for the Professor , it points out that the Royal Family should have nothing to do with the politics of climate change .\nYet today , a decade on , both future monarchs Prince Charles and Prince William , the former in particular in advocating the Great Reset and embracing Greta Thunberg , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David Attenborough , are in climate politics up to their eyeballs .\nPrince

level hoax that came out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you to submit and comply \u2014 \u201c hospitalisations.\n\u201d Why is The Atlantic publishing this ?\nBecause they need to show history ( what will be left of it ) that they knew , \u2018 before anyone \u2019 , that Covid-19 was used , maliciously , by the MainstreamMedia , inept politicians and useful idiots , as tool of fear and panic to wrought ( \u201c Build Back Better \u201d ) \u2018 change \u2019 .\nChange in their own image .\nNot in yours , or , by yours .\nOur Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new study suggests that almost half of those hospitalized with COVID-19 have mild or asymptomatic cases.By David Zweig At least 12,000 Americans have already died from COVID-19 this month , as the country inches through its latest surge in cases .\nBut another worrying statistic is often cited to depict the dangers of this moment : The number of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the United States right now is as high as it has been since the beginning of February .\nIt \u2019 s even worse in certain places : Some states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw their COVID hospitalizations rise to higher levels than at any prior stage of the pandemic .\nBut how much do those latter figures really tell us ?\nFrom the start , COVID hospitalizations have served as a vital metric for tracking the risks posed by the disease .\nLast winter , this magazine described it as \u201c the most reliable pandemic number , \u201d while Vox quoted the cardiologist Eric Topol as saying that it \u2019 s \u201c the best indicator of where we are.\n\u201d On the one hand , death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re a lagging signal and don \u2019 t account for people who suffered from significant illness but survived .\nCase counts , on the other hand , depend on which and how many people happen to get tested .\nPresumably , hospitalization numbers provide a more stable and reliable gauge of the pandemic \u2019 s true toll , in terms of severe disease .\nBut a new , nationwide study of hospitalization records , released as a preprint today ( and not yet formally peer reviewed ) , suggests that the meaning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been shifting over time .\nIf you want to make sense of the number of COVID hospitalizations at any given time , you need to know how sick each patient actually is .\nUntil now , that \u2019 s been almost impossible to suss out .\nThe federal government requires hospitals to report every patient who tests positive for COVID , yet the overall tallies of COVID hospitalizations , made available on various state and federal dashboards and widely reported on by the media , do not differentiate based on severity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical intervention , such as getting intubated .\nOthers require supplemental oxygen or administration of the steroid dexamethasone .\nBut there are many COVID patients in the hospital with fairly mild symptoms , too , who have been admitted for further observation on account of their comorbidities , or because they reported feeling short of breath .\nAnother portion of the patients in this tally are in the hospital for something unrelated to COVID , and discovered that they were infected only because they were tested upon admission .\nHow many patients fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of much speculation .\nIn August , researchers from Harvard Medical School , Tufts Medical Center , and the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System decided to find out .\nResearchers have tried to get at similar questions before .\nFor two separate studies published in May , doctors in California read through several hundred charts of pediatric patients , one by one , to figure out why , exactly , each COVID-positive child had been admitted to the hospital .\nDid they need treatment for COVID , or was there some other reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychiatric episode , and the COVID diagnosis was merely incidental ?\nAccording to the researchers , 40 to 45 percent of the hospitalizations that they examined were for patients in the latter group .\nThe authors of the paper out this week took a different tack to answer a similar question , this time for adults .\nInstead of meticulously looking at why a few hundred patients were admitted to a pair of hospitals , they analyzed the electronic records for nearly 50,000 COVID hospital admissions at the more than 100 VA hospitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see whether each patient required supplemental oxygen or had a blood oxygen level below 94 percent .\n( The latter criterion is based on the National Institutes of Health definition of \u201c severe COVID.\n\u201d ) If either of these conditions was met , the authors classified that patient as having moderate to severe disease ; otherwise , the case was considered mild or asymptomatic .\nThe study found that from March 2020 through early January 2021\u2014before vaccination was widespread , and before the Delta variant had arrived\u2014the proportion of patients with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFrom mid-January through the end of June 2021 , however , that number rose to 48 percent .\nIn other words , the study suggests that roughly half of all the hospitalized patients showing up on COVID-data dashboards in 2021 may have been admitted for another reason entirely , or had only a mild presentation of disease .\nThis increase was even bigger for vaccinated hospital patients , of whom 57 percent had mild or asymptomatic disease .\nBut unvaccinated patients have also been showing up with less severe symptoms , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The study found that 45 percent of their cases were mild or asymptomatic since January 21 .\nAccording to Shira Doron , an infectious-disease physician and hospital epidemiologist at Tufts Medical Center , in Boston , and one of the study \u2019 s co-authors , the latter finding may be explained by the fact that unvaccinated patients in the vaccine era tend to be a younger cohort who are less vulnerable to COVID and may be more likely to have been infected in the past .\nAmong the limitations of the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not representative of the U.S. population as a whole , as they include few women and no children .\n( Still , the new findings echo those from the two pediatric-admissions studies . )\nAlso , like many medical centers , the VA has a policy to test every inpatient for COVID , but this is not a universal practice .\nLastly , most of the data\u2014even from the patients admitted in 2021\u2014derive from the phase of the pandemic before Delta became widespread , and it \u2019 s possible that the ratios @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study did run through June 30 , however , when the Delta wave was about to break , and it did not find that the proportion of patients with moderate to severe respiratory distress was trending upward at the end of the observation period .\nThe idea behind the study and what it investigates is important , says Graham Snyder , the medical director of infection prevention and hospital epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center , though he told me that it would benefit from a little more detail and nuance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an infectious-disease specialist at Columbia University , told me that using other metrics for severity of illness , such as intensive-care admissions , presents different limitations .\nFor one thing , different hospitals use different criteria for admitting patients to the ICU .\nOne of the important implications of the study , these experts say , is that the introduction of vaccines strongly correlates with a greater share of COVID hospital patients having mild or asymptomatic disease .\n\u201c It \u2019 s underreported how well the vaccine makes your life better , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be , and less sick even if hospitalized , \u201d Snyder said .\n\u201c That \u2019 s the gem in this study.\n\u201d \u201c People ask me , \u2018 Why am I getting vaccinated if I just end up in the hospital anyway ?\n\u2019 \u201d Griffin said .\n\u201c But I say , \u2018 You \u2019 ll end up leaving the hospital.\n\u2019 \u201d He explained that some COVID patients are in for \u201c soft \u201d hospitalizations , where they need only minimal treatment and leave relatively quickly ; others may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five days , or with a tube down their throat .\nOne of the values of this study , he said , is that it helps the public understand this distinction\u2014and the fact that not all COVID hospitalizations are the same .\nBut the study also demonstrates that hospitalization rates for COVID , as cited by journalists and policy makers , can be misleading , if not considered carefully .\nClearly many patients right now are seriously ill. We also know that overcrowding of hospitals by COVID patients with even mild illness can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other care .\nAt the same time , this study suggests that COVID hospitalization tallies can \u2019 t be taken as a simple measure of the prevalence of severe or even moderate disease , because they might inflate the true numbers by a factor of two .\n\u201c As we look to shift from cases to hospitalizations as a metric to drive policy and assess level of risk to a community or state or country , \u201d Doron told me , referring to decisions about school closures , business restrictions , mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should refine the definition of hospitalization .\nThose patients who are there with rather than from COVID don \u2019 t belong in the metric.\n\u201d The Atlantic \u2019 s COVID-19 coverage is supported by grants from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation .\nDavid Zweig is a writer based in New York .\nHe is the author of the nonfiction book Invisibles and the novel Swimming Inside the Sun .\n\u2022 COVID-19 : The Authoritarian Left \u2019 s Overt \u2018 Denial of Science \u2019 In A Single Tweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Religion If It Lasts Long Enough | Climatism \u2022 SURPRISE , SURPRISE !\nGlobal Lockdown Every Two Years Needed To Meet Paris CO\u2082 Goals | Climatism \u2022 COVID19 = CLIMATE CHANGE : The More Afraid You Are , The More You Will Accept | Climatism", "author": "Jamie Spry", "url": "https://climatism.wordpress.com/2021/09/15/covid-19-a-shocking-new-study-emerges/", "published": "Tue, 14 Sep 2021 21:40:35 +0000", "published_utc": 1631670035, "collection_utc": 1631658132}, {"id": "climatism--2021-09-19--Arctic Ice Abounds at 2021 Minimum", "date": "2021-09-19", "source": "climatism", "title": "Arctic Ice Abounds at 2021 Minimum", "content": "The images above come from MASIE showing ice extents on day 260 , the lowest daily extent on average the @ @ @ @ @ that 2012 was the lowest in this period and 2021 is now the highest , @ @ @ @ @ of ice this year contrasts with both 2007 and 2020 .\nClearly , the location @ @ @ @ @ varies greatly from year to year .\nThe marginal seas are open water , including @ @ @ @ @ Bays ( Hudson and Baffin ) , and the Atlantic basins for the most part @ @ @ @ @ , other regions retain considerable ice at the annual minimum , with differences year to @ @ @ @ @ between ice and water in the Arctic ocean is now at the maximum for water @ @ @ @ @ September .\nAfter that , diminishing energy from the slowly setting sun allows oceanic cooling @ @ @ @ @ Those interested in the dynamics\u2026", "author": "Jamie Spry", "url": "https://climatism.wordpress.com/2021/09/19/arctic-ice-abounds-at-2021-minimum/", "published": "Sun, 19 Sep 2021 10:33:34 +0000", "published_utc": 1632062014, "collection_utc": 1632090190}, {"id": "climatism--2021-09-20--Finally a Real Crisis: Shortage of Carbon Dioxide", "date": "2021-09-20", "source": "climatism", "title": "Finally a Real Crisis: Shortage of Carbon Dioxide", "content": "\u201c Acute food shortages were feared last night after high gas prices forced most of Britain \u2019 s commercial production @ @ @ @ @ down .\nThe closure of two fertiliser plants in northern England and others in Europe @ @ @ @ @ drink industry facing a shortage of carbon dioxide , which is a byproduct of fertiliser @ @ @ @ @ critical to the production and transport of a range of products , from meat to @ @ @ @ @ drinks.\n\u201d The twisted irony of climate wokeism , on full display ; a shortage @ @ @ @ @ extremist climate policies that aim to \u2018 eliminate \u2019 life-sustaining CO2 in the form of @ @ @ @ @ Not to mention the hard reality of the swift , tangible and disastrous effects to @ @ @ @ @ the knee \u2019 to the anti-human climate lobby , on full display .", "author": "Jamie Spry", "url": "https://climatism.wordpress.com/2021/09/20/finally-a-real-crisis-shortage-of-carbon-dioxide-climatism/", "published": "Mon, 20 Sep 2021 09:00:25 +0000", "published_utc": 1632142825, "collection_utc": 1632133372}, {"id": "climatism--2021-09-21--Perspective : Look Up Your Risk of Dying of COVID-19", "date": "2021-09-21", "source": "climatism", "title": "Perspective : Look Up Your Risk of Dying of COVID-19", "content": "Perspective : Look Up Your Risk of Dying of COVID-19 \u201c Of all tyrannies , a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive.\n\u201d \u2013 C.

to keep you fixated through mechanisms of fear , hysteria and alarm it is perhaps beneficial to be grounded , often , by good old fashioned hard data .\nCDC and Stanford University data demonstrating the actual risk of death by Covid may be one way to help defend against the merciless attack on reason , sanity and calm by Covid-19 power-hungry politicians and compliant mainstream media .\nSome much needed perspective here via Rational Ground : Perspective : Look Up Your Risk of Dying of COVID-19 Get some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kerpen has updated the COVID-19 mortality tables by age \u2013 specific age actually !\nSo look up your own risk between you and your peers below .\n\u2022 First , find your age on the chart on column # 1 .\n\u2022 Second column : how many people your age have died of COVID-19 since January 2020 \u2022 Third column : the number of people in the U.S. who are that age .\n\u2022 Fourth column : the % of the people that age who have died of COVID .\nIf you \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have died of COVID-19 .\nThere are over 4.3 million 49-yr-olds olds \u2013 which means that 0.085 % of 49 year olds have died of COVID .\nAs I always note , if you are over the age of 65 strongly consider getting vaccinated as there is acute risk to you .\nUnder the age of 45 there is a near zero statistical risk of mortality .\nOtherwise \u2013 your choice but stay informed !\nYou might also choose to look up how many people your age have died of ANYTHING since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective on COVID-19 deaths .\nLastly , consider the types of deaths which occur at these ratios .\nWe \u2019 ve mapped these to mortality risks provided by insurance companies for comparison .\nAnd of course we provide some perspective on age comparisons .\nThe median age of death of a COVID-19 victim is about 80 years old .\nThe risk tables show that for every 20 years below 80 your risk decreases by 10x .\nSo if you are 60 your risk is 10x lower than that of an 80 year old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 100x lower and if you are 20 your risk is 1000x ( ONE THOUSAND ! )\ntimes lower than an 80 year old .\nRational Ground \u2013 Clear Reasoning on National Policy for COVID-19 \u00bb Perspective : Look
