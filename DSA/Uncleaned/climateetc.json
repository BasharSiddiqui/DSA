"content": "Looking ahead towards new energy technologies , plus my own saga and rationale for transitioning my personal power generation and consumption .\nHappy New Year everyone !\nThe theme I decided for my post to ring in the New Year is one of optimism re new technologies .\nThe basis for this post is an article by Eli Dourado that I spotted on twitter : Notes on technology for the 2020 \u2019 s .\nWill the new decade be the roaring 20 \u2019 s or the boring 20 \u2019 s ?\nAll are interesting and worth reading , here I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind and solar decade .\nWe observed stunning declines in the cost of both , although total deployment of wind and solar remains small\u2014in 2019 , wind and solar represented less than 9 percent of utility-scale electricity generation in the US .\nIn the 2020s , cost declines will likely stall\u2014wind and solar are already pretty cheap , so the declines of the past decade are not reproducible .\nDeployment , on the other hand , will accelerate .\nMass deployment of wind and solar will bring challenges .\nThese sources are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stops blowing\u2014which happens\u2014we need a way to quickly make up the deficit .\nEach of the three electricity grids in the continental US\u2014east , west , and Texas\u2014has to remain in supply-demand balance every second of every day .\nWe can use grid storage to smooth out some of the bumps , but storage remains expensive .\nTo reach a grid powered entirely by today \u2019 s renewables , we would need storage at a price of $ 20 per kWh ( with caveats ) .\nThat storage doesn \u2019 t all have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s talk about batteries for a bit .\nUsing Tesla \u2019 s grid-scale Powerpack as data , a 232 kWh battery today costs $ 125,793 .\nThat is a price of over $ 542/kWh .\nThrough innovation , that pricetag will come down over the course of this decade , but improvements on the supply side could easily get swamped by increases in demand .\nAfter all , this decade will also include a huge shift toward electric vehicles , which I will discuss below .\nWhen demand outpaces supply , prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is impressive innovation .\nWith increased deployment of intermittent power generation , increased total demand for electricity due to electric vehicles , a high cost of grid storage , inadequate electricity transmission ( have I mentioned that we often neglect to build in this country ? )\n, and strong political support for decommissioning fossil fuel plants , the 2020s may be a time of electric grid instability .\nThis could be tempered to some extent by using car batteries as grid resources and through ( politically unpopular ) variable electricity prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more bullish on solar and particularly wind than I am .\nThe article neglects the challenges of scaling up in terms of land use , resource availability , and seems to accept some level of grid instability .\nUltimately , we need scalable zero-carbon baseload energy , which means nuclear or geothermal .\nThe problem with nuclear is the high cost .\nIf you look at NuScale \u2019 s small modular reactor technology , they are targeting 6.5\u00a2/kWh .\nThat is baseload power , so not directly comparable to wind and solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even so , it isn \u2019 t the most competitive in today \u2019 s market .\nFurthermore , NuScale \u2019 s flagship project was just delayed three years and is now not scheduled to come online until 2030 .\nJC note : Dourado is less optimistic about nuclear costs than others .\nWhat is more plausible this decade is enhanced and advanced geothermal systems .\nThe legacy geothermal industry is sleepy , tapping energy at traditional volcanic hydrothermal hotspots\u2014forget about it .\nThe next generation of the industry , however , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving the oil and gas industry .\nThe startups I have spoken to think with today \u2019 s technology they can crack 3.5\u00a2/kWh without being confined to volcanic regions .\nWith relatively minor advancements in drilling technology compared to what we \u2019 ve seen over the last decade , advanced geothermal could reach 2\u00a2/kWh and become scale to become viable just about anywhere on the planet .\nCollectively , the startups are talking about figures like hundreds of gigawatts of generation by 2030 .\nI \u2019 m watching this space closely ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay in the loop .\nAs I wrote last month , permitting reform will be important .\nJC note : geothermal is the hottest energy technology that is feasible and cheap that I don \u2019 t know enough about .\nThe linked article by Dave Roberts ( first line in preceding paragraph ) is very good .\nFusion continues to make technical progress .\nI expect we will get a demonstration of energy-positive fusion in this decade from one of several fusion startups or perhaps Lockheed Martin \u2019 s compact fusion reactor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from a change that transforms society .\nIt will take further decades to deploy reactors onto the grid .\nBy the time fusion gets there , the energy market will be quite different from when we started working on fusion reactors in the 1940s .\nWind , solar , and hopefully geothermal will make electricity pretty cheap , and fusion will struggle to compete .\nJC note : I don \u2019 t see a long term future for wind energy if there are other economical , clean options available .\nIf fusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be a very attractive option .\nSee also this article on fusion energy .\nConsider : around half the cost of an advanced geothermal plant is drilling , and half is conversion equipment .\nSuppose the plant is amortized over 30 years ( although many geothermal plants last longer ) , and after that period the conversion equipment needs to be replaced .\nBut the hole in the ground does not need to be replaced !\nThat means for the next 30 years , electricity can be generated at half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this decade could be producing at less than 1\u00a2/kWh by the 2050s .\nThat is a tough market for fusion to break into .\nBut fusion will still be a great source of power in applications where other sources aren \u2019 t available , such as in space .\nThe 2020s will be a big decade for sustainable alternative fuels ( SAF ) .\nCommercial aviation can \u2019 t electrify\u2014batteries will never match fossil fuels \u2019 energy density .\nGiven political realities , aviation has no choice to decarbonize , which means either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is much better than batteries , but still not as energy dense as fossil fuels or SAF , and so my money is on SAF , and particularly on fuel made from CO\u2082 pulled from the atmosphere .\nIt is easy to convert atmospheric CO\u2082 to ethanol in solution ; and it is easy to upgrade ethanol into other fuels .\nBut it is hard to separate ethanol from water without using a lot of energy\u2014unless you have an advanced membrane as Prometheus Fuels does .\nI have written about Prometheus before and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology could decarbonize aviation very suddenly .\nJC note : SAF and Prometheus Fuels are new to me .\nThoughts ?\nA few notes on my personal transition to cleaner energy .\nAbout 6 years ago , we needed to purchase some new appliances : hot water heaters , stove top , clothes dryer .\nAt the time we opted for natural gas appliances \u2013 they were more energy efficient and operated more towards our preferences ( not a fan of electric stove top or electric clothes dryer ) .\nI now realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for indoor air quality ; had we realized that at the time , this might have swayed our decision .\nWe also bought a new car about 5 years ago \u2013 internal combustion ; we really need 4 wheel drive where we live and at the time there weren \u2019 t good hybrid or electric options .\nAbout 2 years ago , we decided to make the plunge for rooftop solar for our home , this was eventually installed about a year ago ( 5 years ago , we wouldn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost and available technologies ) .\nWe also purchased two Tesla Powerwalls , which allows us to generate power for our household if the grid electricity is down and also at night .\nAs a second backup , we opted to keep the natural gas Generac ( no simple task to integrate this with the Powerwalls ) .\nAfter tax breaks and rebates , all this cost us about $ 40K .\nBased on our current electricity use , we will break even in about 15 years .\nCaption : 48 solar panels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Powerwalls ( two white vertical rectangles ) and Generac ( white box on the ground ) The primary motivation for us to go solar was energy security ( we already had a natural gas Generac backup system ) ; we would not have gone solar without the Tesla Power Walls .\nThe Generac was kept to provide power in the event of wildfires drastically reducing the incoming solar radiation ( a situation which is not unusual in the Sierra Nevadas ) .\nOur local power generation in Nevada is already pretty clean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air pollution is low and mostly generated by automobiles .\n$ 40K would have been a lot to pay for \u2018 virtue signalling \u2019 for clean energy , when our local power sources are already pretty clean .\nThe next point I want to make is how the infrastructure of solar power changes your outlook on future purchases of appliances , cars , heating and air conditioning .\nRe air conditioning , while we have air conditioning in the house , we use a swamp cooler ( powered by electricity ) which our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owing to to the ventilation .\nNot clear that electric vehicles are the right decision at this point ( our existing cars are running fine ) .\nWe will probably replace the natural gas hot water heaters in the relatively near term , provided that our existing ones can be somehow/somewhere be re-used .\nOur house was built in the 1980 \u2019 s , with a fairly ingenious passive solar design that allows mid winter sun to pour into the house , both directly into living spaces and also into higher levels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also with ceiling fans to bring the heat downwards .\nIn summer , when the sun is angled higher , little sunlight enters into the house .\nSo our wintertime heating bill is relatively low .\nBut over the next 5 years we will probably replace our 3 gas furnaces , will look seriously into heat pumps and alternatives to natural gas furnaces .\nThere are two broad issues here , extending from my personal anecdotes .\nEnergy infrastructure matters \u2013 once infrastructure is in place ( home solar , charging stations for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move towards cleaner and more efficient use of energy become much simpler .\nSecond , your \u2018 best \u2019 decisions made now may become suboptimal in ~5 years time , but you are locked in by the infrastructure ( appliances , power plant , whatever ) .\nBottom line is that \u2018 urgency \u2019 to improve in a \u2018 green \u2019 direction can backfire ; wait until the appliance , power plant whatever comes to the end of its useful life and there will be better options .", "author": "curryja", "url":

first wave?", "date": "2021-01-10", "source": "climateetc", "title": "COVID-19: why did a second wave occur even in regions hit hard by the first wave?", "content": "Many people , myself included , thought that in the many regions where COVID-19 infections were consistently reducing during the summer , indicating that the applicable herd immunity threshold had apparently been crossed , it was unlikely that a major second wave would occur .\nThis thinking has been proved wrong .\nIn this article I give an explanation of why I think major second waves have happened .\n\u2022 The herd immunity threshold ( HIT ) depends positively on the basic reproduction number R and negatively on heterogeneity in susceptibility .\n\u2022 Since neither of the factors on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HIT is not fixed either .\n\u2022 R depends on biological , environmental and sociological factors ; colder weather and the evolution of more transmissible strains likely both increase R ; more ( less ) cautious behaviour and social distancing / restrictions on mixing reduce ( increase ) R .\n\u2022 Second waves were due primarily to changes in these factors increasing R and thus the HIT from below to above the existing level of population immunity .\n\u2022 Heterogeneity in susceptibility is partly biological , but social connectivity differences are key .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the HIT can be represented by a single parameter \u03bb .\n\u2022 \u03bb will always exceed 1 ( its level in a homogeneous population ) ; pre-epidemic \u03bb may be ~4 .\nThe higher \u03bb is , the lower the HIT for any given R .\n\u2022 The natural infection HIT is hence bound to be below the level of { 1 \u2013 1/R } quoted by \u2018 experts \u2019 .\n\u2022 Government restrictions reduce \u03bb as well as R , so the HIT falls less than it would if \u03bb were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an uncontrolled epidemic will substantially exceed the HIT , due to overshoot , so high reported seroprevalence levels can be consistent with a much lower HIT .\nThe herd immunity threshold ( HIT ) for a disease epidemic is the proportion of the population needing to have been infected , and thereby no longer susceptible to infection , before the rate of new infections starts to decline .\nThe HIT depends both on the basic reproduction number for infections ( R ) \u2013 the number of other people that at the start of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average infect \u2013 and the degree of heterogeneity in individuals \u2019 likelihood of being infected ( their susceptibility ) .\nThat likelihood in turn depends on both their social connectivity and biological susceptibility to infection .\nNeither R nor the degree of heterogeneity in susceptibility is fixed in value , so the HIT is not fixed either .\nChanges in population behaviour \u2013 whether arising from government interventions or in response to increasing disease incidence \u2013 affect both R and heterogeneity in susceptibility .\nIn addition , R ( which is proportional to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between individuals ) may vary seasonally , and change as the virus or other infectious organism mutates .\nThe resurgence of COVID-19 infections in a second wave after the summer ended is almost certainly due to some combination of the foregoing sociological and biological factors .\nIt has been claimed that the influence of weather on its transmission is relatively minor , [ 1 ] and it has so far proved difficult to detect seasonality for COVID-19 .\n[ 2 ] However , common colds caused by other coronaviruses are highly seasonal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work on the basis that COVID-19 shares that behaviour .\nI focus in this article on the mathematical dependence of the HIT to R and heterogeneity in susceptibility , and on the factors influencing those controlling variables .\nI also touch on difference between the HIT and the final size of an uncontrolled epidemic .\nI discuss in an appendix how , in my view , changes in the factors influencing R and heterogeneity in susceptibility likely shaped the evolution of the epidemic in western Europe How the HIT varies with R @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the herd immunity threshold varies with R and population heterogeneity in susceptibility to infection .\nThe effect of such heterogeneity on transmission of infection and on the HIT can be represented by a single parameter \u03bb , the heterogeneity factor ( Tkachenko et al .\n2020 ) [ 3 ] , which is a function of population variability in both social connectivity and in biological susceptibility .\n[ 4 ] The reproduction number at any time , R , and the HIT are related as follows to R and \u03bb : where S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains susceptible to infection .\nFor a homogeneous population , these formulae reduce to the classical results R = R \u00d7 S and HIT = 1 \u2013 1/R .\nWith heterogeneity in susceptibility to infection , R falls more than pro rata to the susceptible proportion S decreases .\nInitially , R falls \u03bb times as fast with S as in the homogeneous case .\nNote that an epidemic takes some time to die out after the HIT is reached , since at that point many people will be infected and will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a declining rate .\nTherefore , the final size of the epidemic ( FSE ) \u2013 the attack rate ( the ultimate proportion of the population that has been infected ) \u2013 will exceed the HIT .\nThe columns to the right of each HIT column show ( in italics ) the FSE if social and biological factors remain unchanged throughout the epidemic .\n[ 5 ] As shown in a previous article , [ 6 ] well timed short term restrictions to reduce transmission as the HIT is approached can prevent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Table 1 .\nRelationship of each of the herd immunity threshold ( HIT ) and the final size of the epidemic ( FSE ) with the basic reproduction number R , at varying levels of heterogeneity factor \u03bb that arises from heterogeneity in susceptibility ( assumed gamma-distributed ) across the population , from none ( \u03bb = 1 ) to an estimated normal level ( \u03bb = 4 ) .\nThe FSE values assume that the same R and \u03bb value applied throughout the epidemic .\nSince a person \u2019 s social connectivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contacts with others , equally affects their infectivity , variability in it has a more powerful effect than variability in biological susceptibility .\n[ 7 ] Note that heterogeneity in infectivity that is uncorrelated with susceptibility does not affect the overall progression of an established , large epidemic , although it may affect smaller scale features such as clustering of cases .\nFor a population that is homogeneous in both biological and social components of susceptibility , \u03bb = 1 ( pink columns ) .\nIn that case , the \u2018 classical \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is valid .\nThis formula also applies to immunity gained through vaccination at random , since such vaccination \u2013 unlike natural disease progression \u2013 does not preferentially confer immunity on individuals who are more susceptible to infection ( and also more likely to infect others ) .\nAnalyses of contact networks indicate that , in normal circumstances , the coefficient of variation ( standard deviation / mean ) for social connectivity in a population is about 1 , while biological susceptibility is likely to have a coefficient of variation of about 1/3 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Use of those figures implies that \u03bb = 4 ( green , rightmost columns ) .\nThe effect of government social distancing measures on R and the heterogeneity factor It has been estimated that , prior to significant social distancing taking place , 80 % to 90 % of all transmission of infection is caused by circa 10 % of infected individuals , often at superspreading events where a large number of people are present .\nWhen restrictions on gatherings , bars and other venues are introduced , non-household social mixing generally is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while household mixing will be little affected .\nThe result will be a reduction in R , but also reduced heterogeneity in social connectivity and hence \u03bb .\nA further reduction in both these factors can be expected to occur when a lockdown ( stay-at-home order ) is introduced .\nThe effects of such government measures , for a range of resulting R values , are illustrated by the two middle sets of columns .\nThese both assume the same 1/3 coefficient of variation for biological susceptibility , but a reduction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 0.625 , resulting in \u03bb = 3 ( yellow columns ) or to 0.25 , resulting in \u03bb = 2 ( salmon columns ) .\nEven in the absence of legal restrictions being imposed , people can be expected to significantly change their behaviour when an epidemic involving severe disease takes hold .\nThe resulting reduction in \u03bb , for any given resulting reduction in R , might however be less than under an enforced reduction in mixing , since more gregarious people may be less cautious and reduce their high social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less gregarious people do \u2013 the opposite relationship to that arising from restrictions on gatherings , bars and other venues .\nHow a high seroprevalence level can arise even in the presence of substantial heterogeneity It might be thought that a high attack rate is incompatible with significant population heterogeneity in susceptibility and hence a moderate HIT .\nAn attack rate of 76 % has been claimed for the city of Manaus .\n[ 8 ] However , the weighted measured seroprevalence on which that estimate was based was not from a random @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ 9 ] and never exceeded 44 % [ 10 ] .\nA random population survey found seroprevalence in Manaus to be only between one-quarter one-third the level claimed in the foregoing study , casting severe doubt on its claim .\n[ 11 ] The first mentioned study also estimated that in or just after mid-March , near the start of the epidemic in Manaus , R \u2013 which at that point would not have been far short of R \u2013 was approximately 2.5 , suggesting R was in the 2.6 to 2.8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they estimated applied then was moderate , similar to that near the end of the main epidemic .\nIn a relatively poor city like Manaus with household and transport crowding it seems quite likely that in normal circumstances there is lower population heterogeneity in social connectivity than in a high income city , indicating an heterogeneity factor \u03bb perhaps more like 3 than 4 ( yellow not green columns ) .\nAnd under moderate social distancing the heterogeneity factor \u03bb might be closer to 2 than 3 .\nFor an R of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HIT of 38 % but a final epidemic size ( FSE ) of 64 % [ 12 ] .\nEven at \u03bb = 3 , the FSE would be 49 % ( with an HIT of 27 % ) .\n[ 13 ] To summarize , it seems doubtful that the attack rate in Manaus in fact exceeded 50 % \u2013 it may have been no more than 20-25 % \u2013 and an attack rate of 50 % is fully compatible with the HIT being below 30 % .\nAppendix \u2013 Changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The following discussion , which represents my semi-quantitative broad brush analysis of what has occurred , relates primarily to the progress of the epidemic in western Europe .\nHowever , it may also be somewhat applicable to the north east United States , where the epidemic took off only slightly later than in western Europe and where the seasonal variation in climate is also large .\nIn the initial stages of the first wave , which generally started in major cities , in early spring 2020 , infections appear to have been doubling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governments imposing restrictions or people becoming significantly more cautious .\nDepending on the assumed distribution of the generation interval ( from one infection to those it directly leads to ) , that implies an R value of between 2 and 4 .\n[ 14 ] I will assume a middle of the range R value of 3 for illustrative purposes .\nThat would imply a HIT of 67 % for a homogeneous population , reducing to 24 % for a population with the highest degree of heterogeneity illustrated in Table 1 , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started behaving more cautiously and mixing less .\nWhen people started mixing less , voluntarily or by government fiat , R would have reduced , but as discussed above \u03bb will also have fallen .\nThe combined effect of these changes can be visualised as moving diagonally upwards and leftwards in Table 1 , from the green columns to the yellow columns and then to the salmon columns .\nThe resulting reduction in the HIT would therefore be somewhat smaller than that implied by the reduction in R alone .\nBy late spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely faded , and it generally continued to decline after restrictions on mixing were at least partially relaxed .\nAs summer progressed , people \u2019 s behaviour unsurprisingly returned closer to pre-epidemic norms .\nI will assume for illustrative purposes that the yellow columns ( \u03bb = 3 ) were representative of that period .\nSince by midsummer the epidemic appears to have been declining even where only a minor first wave had occurred , it seems that R must generally have declined to 1 or below , so that population immunity levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is only positive if R > 1 ) .\nAs autumn arrived , infections and then serious illness started to rise again , although where testing was increasing the rise may have been exaggerated .\nIt follows that R must have risen again , resulting in the HIT increasing to above the level of population immunity .\nAn obvious explanation for the rise in R is seasonally reduced sun and cooler weather , with more contact occurring indoors , where almost all COVID-19 transmission appears to take place .\nA major increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , particularly , university terms started likely also boosted R and the level of infections in the autumn ; young adults have generally had the highest incidence rates during the second wave .\n[ 15 ] In some places the rise in infections appears to have occurred slightly earlier , perhaps as a result of holidaymakers returning infected from areas where COVID-19 was more prevalent .\n[ 16 ] Initially it seemed that some large cities where a significant proportion of the population had been infected in the first wave might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase in R evidently became sufficiently large to raise the HIT to above the level of population immunity .\nAs a result of increasing infections , government-imposed restrictions were generally increased , which as well as reducing R will also have reduced the heterogeneity factor \u03bb .\nThis can be visualised as a move diagonally upwards from the yellow columns to the salmon columns .\nThose actions appear typically to have pushed R down to about 1 , or slightly lower , which in the presence of a reasonable degree of existing population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 .\nWith reduced heterogeneity , the existing level of population immunity causes a lesser reduction in R , relative to R , but R will still be a smaller fraction of R than the proportion of the population that remains susceptible to infection .\nIn the UK , and possibly various other countries , a new lineage ( B.1.1.7 ) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has now emerged [ 17 ] and grown faster than existing ones , as discussed in a previous article [ 18 ] .\nSince writing that article , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence that B.1.1.7 is 25\u201350 % more infectious than pre-existing variants .\n[ 19 ] On the other hand , recent data from the regions where B.1.1.7 has become dominant suggests that it may now be growing no faster than other variants .\n[ 20 ] It has been suggested that the fast growth in the regions where B.1.1.7 now dominates may have been at least partly due to it spreading there in schools .\n[ 21 ] However , making for illustrative purposes the assumption that B.1.1.7 is actually 25\u201350 % more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps typically reaching somewhere in the range1.5 to 2.0 once B.1.1.7 becomes the dominant variant , if R was previously in the 1.2 to 1.4 range .\nTougher restrictions that have been introduced in a number of countries in response to infection rates increasing , whether due to the spread of the B.1.1.7 lineage , to cold winter weather or to greater mixing , will have reduced population heterogeneity in social connectivity further .\nIn these circumstances , is unclear whether existing levels of population immunity will suffice to prevent further growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather similar one that has emerged in South African , even with severe restrictions being introduced .\nHowever , increased population immunity resulting from some combination of further spread of infections and vaccination programmes , the combination varying from one country and region to another , should bring COVID-19 epidemics under control within the next few months .\n[ 1 ] \u201c All pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions are currently believed to have a stronger impact on transmission over space and time than any environmental driver.\n\u201d Carlson CJ , Gomez AC , Bansal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather and seasonality must not misguide COVID-19 response

and \u2022 the effect of climate system internal variability on temperature , particularly SST , patterns which give rise to respectively the forced and unforced pattern effects .\nThe importance of distinguishing between forced and unforced pattern effects A serious shortcoming in both Andrews et al ( 2018 ) and Zhou et al ( 2021 ) is that they only estimate the total pattern effect .\n[ 6 ] But its forced and unforced components have very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future warming develops .\nThe forced pattern effect is very difficult to identify in observations , however it occurs in a large majority of coupled GCMs [ 7 ] in simulations driven by increased CO concentration .\nWithin a decade after such an increase , their surface warming patterns change and their climate feedback strength starts to decline to a somewhat lower level .\nTherefore , coupled GCM \u2019 s long term climate feedback strength is overestimated , and their equilibrium climate sensitivity ( ECS ) underestimated , if based on data from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CO concentration \u2013 which broadly corresponds to data available from the historical period .\nNevertheless , if there were only a forced pattern effect over the historical period , then coupled GCM behaviour implies that use of \u2018 effective climate sensitivity \u2019 estimates that correctly reflect warming and energy budgets over the historical period can be expected to result in very little underestimation of committed warming up to 2100 , [ 8 ] or until the mid-2100s for warming from increases in forcing between now and then , with underestimation only emerging slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there were also a non-negligible positive unforced pattern effect component over the historical period , then as soon as the internal variability excursion causing it ends , global mean temperature would rapidly increase .\nMoreover , historical period \u2018 effective climate sensitivity \u2019 estimates would be further biased low .\nTherefore , using them could significantly underestimate both committed warming and warming from future forcing increases over the current century , not just in the longer run as for a forced pattern effect .\nSince forced and unforced pattern effects have very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warming , it is important to produce separate estimates of their magnitudes over the historical period .\nLewis and Mauritsen ( 2020 ) [ 10 ] showed that the estimated magnitude of the historical period unforced pattern effect is strongly dependent , in at least one model [ 11 ] , on the observational SST dataset used .\nWe found it to be significant when employing AMIP2 SST , as is usual in the SST-driven climate model simulations involved , but negligible when UK Met Office HadISST1 SST data was employed .\n[ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most useful contribution of Zhou et al ( 2021 ) is this .\nThey carried out simulations with another model , CAM5.3 , driven by HadISST1 SST data as well as by the usual AMIP2 SST data .\nThey also performed an abrupt4xCO2 simulation for CAM5.3 in coupled mode .\nIn this article , I will show what the implications of their CAM5.3 simulations are for the forced pattern effect and \u2013 based on each of AMIP2 and HadISST1 SST data \u2013 for the unforced historical pattern effect .\nThe forced pattern effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitivity change over time ?\nStandard practice is to estimate the ECS of a coupled GCM by running a simulation under preindustrial conditions until a near-equilibrium state is reached , and then performing a 150 year long simulation at the start of which the CO concentration is quadrupled ( \u2018 abrupt4xCO2 \u2019 ) .\nUsually ECS is estimated from the x-intercept of a linear OLS [ 13 ] regression fit of top-of-atmosphere radiative imbalance ( global heating rate , N ) to global near-surface air temperature ( T ) , both expressed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ 14 ] .\nThe x-intercept value , which corresponds to a stable state with zero net heating , is generally halved to convert from a quadrupling of CO concentration to the doubling specified for ECS .\n[ 15 ] The climate feedback parameter ( \u03bb ) is taken as the negative of the regression fit line \u2019 s slope .\n[ 16 ] When estimating feedbacks in amipPiForcing simulations there are good arguments for using surface temperature ( Ts \u2013 SST over ocean and land skin temperature ) rather than near-surface air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nZhou has previously done so , and I do so here .\nThe effect of such blending of temperature measures is extremely small in CAM5.3 ; Ts increases by 1.0 % less than T over the abrupt4xCO2 simulation , implying an ECS of 2.97 K rather than 3.00 K per Zhou et al .\nFigure 1 shows the CAM5.3 abrupt4xCO2 simulation annual Ts and N values ( blue line ) .\n[ 17 ] The leftmost end of the line shows the year 1 mean values .\nThe red line shows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ECS estimate .\nIts slope implies \u03bb = 1.32 Wm\u22122K\u22121 ; the x-intercept of 5.94 K corresponds to an ECS of 2.97 K when halved .\nIn order to estimate the forced pattern effect for CAM5.3 , one also needs an estimate of its climate feedback value that would have been applicable over the historical period .\nThis can be estimated from the slope of a regression fit over the first twenty to fifty years of its abrupt4xCO2 simulation .\nFigure 1 .\nPlot of annual mean \u0394Ts and N values over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linear OLS regression fits thereto over years 1\u2013150 and 1\u201320 .\nThe x-intercepts of approximately 6 K imply an ECS of 3 K ( from the years 1\u2013150 fit line ) and a marginally lower effective climate sensitivity estimate ( from the years 1\u201320 fit line ) , if halved to convert from 4\u00d7 CO to 2\u00d7 CO ( as is usually done ) .\nThe climate feedback parameter , \u03bb , estimates over years 1\u2013150 and 1\u201320 are the negatives of the relevant regression line slopes .\nExamination of the amipPiForcing data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first twenty years would be more appropriate here .\nDoing so ( green line in Figure 1 ) gives a 4.5 % higher \u03bb estimate , of 1.38 Wm\u22122K\u22121 , than regression over years 1\u2013150 ; the resulting effective climate sensitivity estimate of 2.90 K is just 2.4 % smaller than the ECS estimate .\n[ 18 ] I use the 0.06 Wm\u22122K\u22121 excess of the climate feedback estimate from regressing abrupt4xCO2 data spanning years 1\u201320 ( \u03bb ) over that from regressing data spanning years 1\u2013150 ( \u03bb ) as the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forced pattern effect applicable to the historical period in CAM5.3 .\nThe forced pattern effect on outgoing radiation is then obtained as : Zhou et al .\nalso mention , but do not explore , the possibility of estimating the ( total ) pattern effect using a long term \u03bb value calculated using years 21\u2013150 rather than 1\u2013150 abrupt4xCO2 data .\nIssues when estimating such a \u03bb value are discussed in an Appendix to this article .\nZhou et al .\nestimate the total pattern effect over the historical period by comparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , based on CAM5.3 amipPiForcing simulations driven by AMIP2 SST and sea-ice data , as is standard for such simulations .\nHowever , they also perform such simulations driven by HadISST1 SST data .\nZhou et al .\nestimate the total pattern effect using a long term climate feedback parameter , estimated over years 1\u2013150 of the abrupt4xCO2 simulation , \u03bb .\nI do the same as them to estimate the unforced pattern effect over the historical period , but using a climate feedback parameter estimated over years 1\u201320 of the CAM5.3 abrupt4xCO2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the model \u2019 s forced response during the historical period .\nFigure 2 shows how the unforced pattern effect ( unforced outgoing radiation ) varies during the CAM5.3 amipPiForcing AMIP2 and HadISST1 based simulations ; 3-year year running means are plotted as doing so produces a clearer comparison .\n[ 19 ] It can be seen that until just after 1980 the two datasets produce quite similar pattern effects .\nThat is as expected , because the AMIP2 dataset uses HadISST1 sea-ice data ( with minor adjustments ) throughout the historical period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , albeit with an altered anomalisation pattern .\n[ 20 ] However , from late 1981 on AMIP2 uses a different SST dataset and the pattern effect estimates diverge substantially .\nBoth datasets produce a positive pattern effect from the late 1990s on , but its magnitude is far larger using the AMIP2 dataset .\nZhou et al.\n\u2019 s main estimate of the total pattern effect , of 0.63 Wm\u22122 , uses AMIP2 data and is based on the mean over the five year period 2006\u20132010 .\nAlthough I use surface temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( T ) data , when using AMIP2 data I obtain an identical 0.63 Wm\u22122 estimate for the total pattern effect over that period , and a 0.59 Wm\u22122 estimate for the unforced pattern effect ( horizontal red line in Figure 2 ) .\n[ 21 ] However , based on HadISST1 SST data , the unforced pattern effect estimated over 2006\u20132010 is little more than half that based on AMIP2 data , at 0.34 Wm\u22122 ( horizontal blue line in Figure 2 ) .\nFigure 2 .\nPlot of 3-year running average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the historical period , based on ensemble means from three CAM5.3 amipPiForcing simulation runs each driven by either AMIP2 data ( red line ) or HadISST1 SST data ( blue line ) .\nThe values plotted are global outgoing radiation to space minus the product of global surface temperature and the climate feedback parameter estimated over years 1\u201320 of the CAM5.3 abrupt4xCO2 simulation , as anomalies relative to the 1871\u20131880 means .\nColour-matching horizontal lines show means of annual data over 2006\u20132010 for simulations based on both datasets , and over 2015\u20132017 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends in 2010 .\nThe distorting effect of the Hiatus Although Zhou et al .\nperformed simulations based on AMIP2 \u2013 their primary dataset \u2013 extending to 2017 , they used 2006-2010 as the period over which to estimate the pattern effect for CAM5.3 .\n[ 22 ] However , 2006\u20132010 is not very representative of the historical period since it falls within the last \u2018 hiatus \u2019 , during which global temperature increased much less that was expected given the continuing strong increase in greenhouse gas concentrations .\nThe most convincing explanations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pacific area caused by strong decadal internal variability , which for about a decade suppressed warming without a commensurate reduction in outgoing radiation .\nCooling in the eastern Pacific relative to the west Pacific warm pool , as occurred in the hiatus , and the associated increase in low cloud cover in the eastern Pacific and other tropical areas , is expected to increase outgoing radiation .\nIn other words , internal variability caused a positive pattern effect during the hiatus .\nSince Zhou \u2019 s AMIP2-based amipPiForcing simulation extends to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over by the end of 2014 , one can form an AMIP2-based estimate of the post-hiatus pattern effect magnitude by taking its mean over 2015\u20132017 .\n[ 23 ] Although this is an even shorter averaging period than used by Zhou et al .\n( 3 rather than 5 years ) , the estimation uncertainty should not be hugely greater .\n[ 24 ] Over 2015\u20132017 , the estimated AMIP2-based unforced pattern effect is 0.29 Wm\u22122 ( rightmost horizontal red line in Figure 2 ) , 0.30 Wm\u22122 lower than that over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue his HadISST1-based amipPiForcing simulation beyond 2010 .\nHowever , it appears that the divergence between the AMIP2- and HadISST1-based unforced pattern effect estimates very largely arose in the later part of the 20th century ; it is unconnected with the hiatus .\nSince the mid-1990s the difference between them has been fairly stable , albeit fluctuating .\nThere is almost no trend in the difference over either the ten or fifteen years to 2010 .\n[ 25 ] One can therefore use the difference between the AMIP2-based unforced pattern effect estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proxy for the corresponding difference for HadISST1-based estimates .\nDoing so implies a HadISST1-based post-hiatus unforced pattern effect estimate over 2015\u20132017 of merely 0.04 Wm\u22122 .\nThis is negligible , and far below estimation uncertainty .\n[ 26 ] Zhou et al.\n\u2019 s pattern effect estimates are applicable only to the unusual hiatus period .\nInsofar as historical period climate sensitivity estimates are dominated by the hiatus period , it might nevertheless be reasonable to use them when estimating the effect on committed warming since early industrial times .\nHowever , previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget climate sensitivity estimates formed using different periods , or using regression over the full period ( Lewis and Curry 2015 [ 27 ] , Lewis and Curry 2018 , Otto et al .\n2013 [ 28 ] ) .\nMoreover , Lewis and Mauritsen ( 2020 ) found a negligible unforced pattern effect when estimating it by regression using HadISST1 data over 1871\u20132010 period .\nZhou et al.\n\u2019 s focus on AMIP2 SST based pattern effect estimates , which are much higher than those derived using HadISST1 data , is unfortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after 1981 , uses SST data derived using an interpolation method that is arguably less suitable for estimating the pattern effect than the method used by HadISST1 ( Lewis and Mauritsen 2020 ) .\nWhen HadISST1 SST data are used , the estimated post-hiatus unforced pattern effect is negligible .\nOn that basis , committed future warming accounting will be almost unaffected by the pattern effect over the rest of this century , since the forced pattern effect only increases warming very slowly [ 8 ] .\nUse of \u2018 effective climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and energy budgets over the full historical period , and are not unduly influenced by the hiatus , can accordingly be expected to result in very little underestimation of committed warming up to 2100 , at least , if GCM amipPiForcing simulations based on HadISST1 data are a guide..\nWhen AMIP2 SST data are used , there is a non-negligible ( but of uncertain significance ) estimated post-hiatus unforced pattern effect , but it is only half the magnitude of that estimated over 2006-2010 , the period used by Zhou et al .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zelinka , M.

and Free podcast .\nI recently did an interview with Christopher Balkaran on his Strong and Free podcast [ link ] While I wasn \u2019 t previously aware of Balkaran or his podcast , you can see why I agreed to this interview , from these excerpts from the \u2018 About \u2019 page : \u201c I created the Strong and Free Podcast to explore news topics by gathering multiple perspectives together and allowing people and organizations to discuss their opinions with detail .\nThis allows for a nuanced conversation .\nIt also means putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fullest .\nIt means making all guests feel welcomed to share their opinions safely , without fear that the host will paint them into a corner , or make them sound incoherent .\nI want this place to be truly safe .\nI believe everyone , even those I disagree with , deserve to be treated with respect and to be on the Podcast to share their perspective .\nIt also means having a concrete discussion on issues and determining the best way forward .\nAs long as we restore thoughtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time our conversations will have deep , valuable meaning .\nAnd , we enrich our own opinion.\n\u201d We covered a lot of topics that I think will provide good fodder for discussion and debate here .\nHere is a transcript of the interview ( quicker to read than to listen to the hour long podcast ) .\nI edited the transcript eliminate thousands of \u2018 like \u2019 , \u2018 you know \u2019 , \u2018 okay \u2019 ( I am really a much better writer than speaker ) .\nI also edited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWelcome to the Strong and Free podcast where my goal is to showcase multiple perspectives on the topics and ideas of our time , regardless of your politics and views , you will find a home here because I simply have no agenda to push .\nMy name is Christopher Balkaran and let \u2019 s start the conversation .\nChristopher Balkaran : So I wanted to pose this question to you , even though I know you can \u2019 t reply because this is a podcast .\nBut how often have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their field that have openly questioned and been critical of the findings and the climate modeling put forward by the intergovernmental panel for climate change ?\nI know I haven \u2019 t , and I know the majority of us probably haven \u2019 t .\nSo I want to just sit down with professor Judith Curry .\nProfessor Curry has been openly critical of the intergovernmental panel for climate change .\nProfessor Curry openly accepts that climate change is real and it is happening , but the topic is so , so complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do is also complex .\nBut so often today we hear about these very simple slogans and solutions to climate change , you know , just to accept the science and provide a rebuttal or to meet these , these lofty targets at a global scale , which is so challenging because every country , every region has differentt issues , but getting countries around the world to all agree on common goals , is very , very challenging .\nSo I wanted to sit down with Professor Curry to understand a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modeling that has been put forward by the IPCC is flawed y .\nAnd also what professor Curry would do if she were in power in terms of what policies should be pursued .\nI hope we can continue having these conversations with multiple perspectives on climate change .\nJudith Curry : My pleasure .\nThanks for the invite .\nChristopher Balkaran : You are so well known in the climate change and climatology space .\nBut before we get into that , I want to know a little bit more from you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nJudith Curry : Okay .\nI guess it goes back to fifth grade .\nI was in a little academically talented group that was selected for broader exposure to things , beyond the normal curriculum .\nAnd this geologist came to talk to us and I was fascinated .\nSo I really started liking that .\nWhen considering majors in college , in the seventies geology was really too qualitative of a field .\nSo I wanted to combine this with physics .\nAnd then at the university where I was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had the sameconnection to the natural world , but seemed more physically based at least at the time .\nAnd then I continued on for my PhD at University of Chicago in the department of geophysical sciences .\nAnd this was late seventies , early eighties .\nMy PhD thesis was on the the role of radiative transfer in Arctic weather .\nI wasn \u2019 t really thinking in terms of manmade climate change at that point .\nBut understanding the processes in the Arctic atmosphere and sea ice became a pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd so , I still have my foot in what I would call the weather field , but I also do climate dynamics in the Arctic , but also more broadly at this point .\nChristopher Balkaran : And how was the conversation on climate change in the seventies and eighties ?\nDefinitely we \u2019 ll talk a little bit more about what it is today , but what were some of the major issues that climatology and environmental sciences ?\nJudith Curry : Climate change wasn \u2019 t a really big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , it was all about geophysical fluid dynamics , trying to understand the circulations of atmosphere and the ocean , tradiative transfer , cloud physics .\nIt was , it was very physics based .\nI would hear in the media about people talking about , Oh , the ice age is coming , or doom and gloom from CO2 emissions , but nobody was really paying attention to all that very much in terms of what I would say the mainstream field until the late 1980s , really .\nThere were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this publicly and painting alarming scenarios on both sides , the cold and the warm side , and most people that I knew and where I was , nobody was really paying much attention to all that .\nChristopher Balkaran : It \u2019 s so fascinating that you say that because you know , me being a kid of the nineties watching Captain Planet and other cartoons at a young age , all I heard of , on a much smaller scale was how important the environment is .\nIt \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spheres of our discourse .\nBut in the late eighties , you start seeing this kind of discussion on climate change .\nWhat do you think are , were some of the underpinnings that guided both sides , was kind of this kind of protest towards big oil or capitalism more broadly ?\nJudith Curry : Well , a lot of it comes from the UN Environmental Program .\nAt the time , there was a push towards world government , socialistic kind of leanings , don \u2019 t like capitalism and big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes from that kind of thinking .\nAnd the UNEP was one of the sponsoring organizations for the IPCC .\nAnd so that really engaged more climate scientists and really brought it more into the mainstream .\nBut in the early days , a lot of scientists didn \u2019 t like this at all , they didn \u2019 t think that we should be going in this direction .\nAnd this was even the World Climate Research program and the World Meteorological Organization , they didn \u2019 t want to get involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IPCC .\nThey said , this is just a whole political thing .\nThis is not what we do .\nWe seek to understand all the processes and climate dynamics , we don \u2019 t want to go there .\nAnd that was really a pretty strong attitude , through , I would say the mid nineties , say 1995 .\nWe had the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change at that point , they \u2019 re trying to get a big treaty going .\nAnd so defenders of the IPCC started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us or challenges us , they are in the pay of big oil .\nAfter that , it became much more difficult to really challenge all that .\nAnd certainly by the turn of the century , anybody who was questioning the hockey stick or any of these other things were slammed as deniers and ostracized .\nAnd then after Climategate in 2010 , the consensus enforcers became very militant .\nSo it \u2019 s a combination of politics , and some mediocre scientists trying to protect their careers .\nAnd , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for career advancement , and it gives them a seat at the big table and political power .\nAll this reinforces pretty shoddy science and overconfidence in their expert judgment , which comprises the IPCC assessment reports .\nAnd then at some point you start to get second order belief .\nI mean , it \u2019 s such a big , complex problem .\nIndividual scientists only look at a piece of it , and then they start accepting what the consensus says on the other topics .\nA scientist working on some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little about carbon dioxide , the carbon budget , radiative transfer , all that fundamental science , but they will accept the climate consensus because it \u2019 s easy and good for their career .\nAnd so it just becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy .\nAnd now we have way too much confidence in some very dubious climate models and inadequate data sets .\nAnd we \u2019 re not really framing the problem broadly enough to really understand what \u2019 s going on with the climate and to make credible projections about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see in the 21st century .\nChristopher Balkaran : Just as a student who is always looking at reports to understand a little bit more about topics , we have Statistics Canada .\nSo always reading stats can reports on different segments of the population and how they \u2019 re dealing with certain government interventions , whatever they may be .\nIn October , I did a series on abortion in Canada and looking at the statistics behind abortion , and I had this kind of recurring thought about climate change .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientist and I want to fully study climate change in a specific way , I \u2019 m dependent in some part , perhaps a large part on government funding .\nAnd if government is politicized in saying climate change is happening and it \u2019 s human caused or , or whatever the case is , if my research doesn \u2019 t align with that , I can see my research being defunded .\nAnd then I think , well , if the public is only seeing the research that government is funding or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funding , It \u2019 s not really unbiased research .\nJudith Curry : Well , it \u2019 s worse than that because the government funding is not that they just re reject those kinds of proposals .\nThey make it hard for you to even submit them because their announcement of opportunity for proposals already implicitly or explicitly assume this , and they are soliciting proposals on impacts of manmade , global warming , regional impacts on whatever .\nSo there \u2019 s already either an implicit or explicit assumptions about all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s really the independent scientists , retired people , people in the private sector , independently wealthy people who are doing this work .\nChristopher Balkaran : Professor from your experience , what do you think has been some of the major causes for this shift in how we understand climate change , especially given how recent relatively it is and why do you believe it \u2019 s so politicized .\nJudith Curry : Well , there is almost certainly a signal of manmade emissions the earth climate .\nAll other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it would otherwise be .\nThe real issue is the magnitude of man-made warming relative to the whole host of other things that go on in the natural climate system .\nAnd then the bigger issue is really whether this warming is dangerous .\nYou know , a certain amount of warming is generally regarded by people as a good thing .\nBut a whole lot of warming , isn \u2019 t especially a good thing , especially if it \u2019 s melting ice sheets and causing sea level rise .\nSea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd the manmade warming that we \u2019 ve seen so far , I don \u2019 t think is really contributing much to the sea level rise that we \u2019 ve observed so far .\nI mean , that \u2019 s just a much longer term processes .\nAnd even if we stopped emitting carbon dioxide today , the sea level rise would keep rising .\nSo , the climate system is way more complex than just something that you can tune , with a CO2 control knob .\nThat just isn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : And that \u2019 s exactly what I want to chat with you about because you \u2019 ve been quite skeptical of climate change modeling .\nFor those on the outside , looking in , it \u2019 s extremely challenging for anyone to be that familiar or , have a good command of the science .\nA common theme I hear from my friends is I just accept the science when it comes to climate change .\nCan you explain to me why , first of all , so let \u2019 s be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex .\nAnd then why are you skeptical of current climate change modeling , and why am I the only one that feels that there \u2019 s just not enough skepticism of climate change modeling and there \u2019 s just blind acceptance sometimes of what we \u2019 re being told .\nJudith Curry : Okay .\nThe climate models originated from weather forecast models , and then they added an ocean then land surface biosphere , and then chemical processes , and now ice sheets .\nThey keep adding all these modules and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basic dynamics are driven by the same kind of models that model the weather .\nWe \u2019 ve learned a lot from climate models , by running experiments , turning things off , turning things on adjusting parameters , taking clouds out , taking sea ice out , holding the sea surface temperature constant in the tropical central Pacific and see what happens , you know , we learn how the climate works by using climate models in that way .\nHowever , the most consequential applications of climate models are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate change , how much the climate change is going to change in the 21st century and what \u2019 s causing extreme weather events .\nI mean , those are the more consequential applications and climate models aren \u2019 t fit for any of those purposes .\nAnd that \u2019 s pretty much acknowledged even in the IPCC report .\nWell , they , they do claim that they can attribute the global warming , but this can \u2019 t be easily separated from the natural variability associated with large-scale ocean circulations .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate models to do that involves circular reasoning , where they throw out climate simulations that really don \u2019 t match what was observed .\nSo you , you end up , even if you \u2019 re not explicitly tuning to the climate record , you \u2019 re implicitly tuning .\nAnd then the thing with extreme events , weather events is beyond silly because these climate models can \u2019 t resolve the extreme events and they can \u2019 t simulate the ocean circulation patterns that really determine the locations of these extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about 21st century , the only thing they \u2019 re looking at is the manmade human emissions forcing , they \u2019 re not predicting solar variability .\nThey \u2019 re not not predicting volcanic eruptions .\nThey can \u2019 t even predict the timing of these multidecadal to millennial ocean oscillation .\nSo all they \u2019 re looking at is this one little piece .\nOkay .\nSo , what are you supposed to do with all that ?\nNot sure we know much more than the sign of the change from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more warming .\nAnd then there \u2019 s another thing .\nThe most recent round of global climate model simulations , the so-called CMIP5 for the IPCC 6th assessment report .\nAll of a sudden the sensitivity to CO2 the range has substantially increased in a lot of the models , way outside the bounds on the high side of what we thought was plausible , even five years ago .\nSo what are we to make of that ?\nAnd how did that happen ?\nWell , it , it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather arcane issue related to how clouds cloud particles interact with aerosol particles .\nBy adding some extra degrees of freedom into the model related to clouds , then it becomes all of a sudden way more sensitive to increases in CO2 .\nWhat are we supposed to make of that ?\nI mean , we do not have a convergent situation with these climate models .\nAnd this is not mention that the 21st century projections from the climate models , don \u2019 t include solar variations .\nThey don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of these things that they don \u2019 t include .\nSo what are we left with ?\nAnd then there are these precise targets , such as we will exceed our carbon budget in 2038 .\nThis is way too much precision that is derived from these very inadequate climate models .\nChristopher Balkaran : Everything that you said professor makes so much sense , and I can \u2019 t understand how results from the climate models can totally shift the politics of almost every nation in the world including Canada here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entire section in their policy platform about climate change and what their government would do to fight it .\nThat wasn \u2019 t always the case and routinely political parties were challenged for not doing enough .\nWe need to have a healthy level of skepticism here .\nJudith Curry : Well , first off , people are looking for simple problems with simple solutions , and they thought that climate change was a simple problem , sort of like the ozone hole .\nStop emitting chloroflourocarbons \u2013 stop the ozone hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global warming .\nThere \u2019 s no way we \u2019 re going to make progress on CO2 emissions until we come up with alternatives that are reliable , abundant , secure , economical , et cetera , Wind and solar , aren \u2019 t the answer .\nAll other things being equal , everybody would prefer clean over dirty energy .\nThat \u2019 s a no brainer , maybe a few coal companies prefer dirty , but everybody would prefer clean , clean energy , but they \u2019 re not willing to sacrifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSo it just doesn \u2019 t make sense .\nAll of these targets and promises about energy are just so much hot air , if you will , sound and fury .\nWe don \u2019 t have solutions and nobody \u2019 s meeting their targets .\nI mean , all they do is go to these meetings , make more and more stringent commitments that everyone knows aren \u2019 t going to be met .\nAnd at the same time , we \u2019 re not dealing with the real problems that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a big issue , we either have too much or too little .\nIndependent of man-made global warming , let let \u2019 s sort out our water supply systems and our flood management strategies .\nHow , how do we prepare for droughts ?\nLets focus on the current problems that we have \u2013 food , water , and energy .\nThose are the three big ones .\nAnd the other thing , while we \u2019 re trying to make energy cleaner , we \u2019 re basically sacrificing grid electricity for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhibiting their development .\nHow does that help human development and human wellbeing ?\nIt makes no sense .\nEven if we were successful , say stopping CO2 emissions by 2050 we might see a few tenths of a degree reduction in the warming by the end of the 21st century , how does that help us now ?\nWhat we should worry more about is our vulnerability to hurricanes and floods and wildfires , and all of these kinds of hazardous events that have happened since time immemorial .\nWhether or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of the century is less important than really figuring out how to deal with them now .\nIf we are concerned about reducing our vulnerability , all the money that we spend thinking we \u2019 re reducing CO2 emissions , it could be applied to these other problems , such as better managing water resources , decreasing our vulnerability to extreme weather events and so on .\nSo there are many more sensible things that we could be doing .\nIt \u2019 s an opportunity cost \u2013 all of this focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century technologies distracts from addressing the fact that we need new technologies .\nChristopher Balkaran : When you look at ancient societies , they dealt with the immediate needs and immediate concerns .\nAnd I think what I want to emphasize too , is we \u2019 re not saying governments aren \u2019 t doing this .\nI \u2019 m sure they are , but to the extent in which they can be doing them and making them a priority , as much as they \u2019 re making , you know , the Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curry : Actually people are doing a lot less of that than you think , because , you know , especially in the developing world , such as South Asia where they just get hammered with hurricane after flood , after whatever .\nEach one of these events sets them back a generation in terms of trying to get ahead \u2013 they lose all their livestock and seeds and , it sets them back enormously .\nThen we spend all our money trying to clean up the mess afterwards .\nWhy not help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can develop economically and better protect themselves .\nAgain , the problem is over simplifying the problem and the solution , and then tying this in with some broader political agendas , such as anti-capitalistm and world government .\nMany people have bought all this largely because they \u2019 ve been scared .\nChristopher Balkaran : You know , professor , everything that you \u2019 ve said is very reasonable and , you know , most people they , those familiar with the scientific method would think , Oh , this makes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January , 2017 , you leave academia because of their very poisonous nature on human caused global warming .\nAnd I know for a fact that there are so many people that share that this idea of they can \u2019 t even have a conversation anymore .\nJudith Curry : I regard myself as sort of a centrist .\nI \u2019 m politically independent .\nI don \u2019 t have any allegiance to one side or the other..\nI understand the complexity of the problems , and I don \u2019 t really advocate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t think of any that I would want to advocate for that actually makes sense .\nYou know , other than broadly talking about , we need to adapt no matter what , and if you want clean energy , you need to invest in better technologies .\nYou \u2019 re not gon na get very far in preventing climate change by trying to massively deploy 20th century technologies .\nThese are the kind of general statements that I \u2019 ve been making .\nBut because I wasn \u2019 t actively advocating with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the behavior of some of the scientists involved in the climate gate episode .\nI got booted over to the denier side .\nAnd they tried to cancel me .\nI don \u2019 t have any allegiance to the extremes of either side of this , but the alarmists seem to be completely intolerant to disagreement and criticism .\nThere \u2019 s crazy people on both sides of the debate .\nThere \u2019 s a range of credible perspectives that I try to consider .\nit \u2019 s a very complex problem and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet Christopher Balkaran : And it \u2019 s fascinating to me that being in the center puts you at odds with academia and that you felt forced out almost because of the very poisonous nature .\nTo me , it \u2019 s like the there \u2019 s an extremist view that has taken over academia and has taken over our discourse .\nI want to learn from you , how can we reverse this ?\nAnd re-institute a healthy level of skepticism and saying , I don \u2019 t accept fully the IPCCs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and we should be able to talk and convey that message in a straightforward manner .\nJudith Curry : Well , you know , I wish I knew .\nThere \u2019 s a social contract between policy makers and the scientists , which sort of reinforces all this .\nI thought maybe that could be broken with president Trump , but a whole lot of other things got broken under president Trump , but not that one in particular .\nSo , I don \u2019 t know what it would take .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hit another slowdown in warming .\nAnd then maybe that will wake people up a little bit more .\nWe just have to wait and see how the climate change actually plays out .\nWe could be waiting 30 years , which is a long time during which a lot of stupid things can happen in the meantime .\nChristopher Balkaran : I just want to quickly mention your blog Climate Etc , which is filled with articles .\nI had Andy West on , and he \u2019 s talked a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been built .\nBut there was a really interesting quote that I found in one of your articles .\nYou said \u201c we \u2019 re breeding a generation of climate scientists who analyze climate model outputs , who come up with sexy conclusions and get published in Nature .\nLike we won \u2019 t be able to grow grapes for wine in California in 2100 , that kind of stuff gets headlines .\nIt gets grants .\nIt feeds our reputation .\nIt \u2019 s cheap , easy science .\nBut t \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on inadequate climate models , especially when you \u2019 re trying to look at regional climate change .\nThat is where the field is going .\nWe \u2019 ve lost a generation of climate dynamism , and that \u2019 s what worries me greatly.\n\u201d Judith Curry : Okay .\nI call that climate model taxonomy , where you look at the outputs of climate models mostly regionally , and then over interpret them , relating the output to some really bad impact act .\nBut it \u2019 s scientifically completely meaningless .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ t have any skill on regional spatial scales .\nAnd second , when climate scientists start making these linkages with wine growing or whatever , they forget a whole lot of other ancillary factors like land use and , all sorts of other things that can contribute to whatever they might be looking at .\nAnd it ends up with climate change being the dominant narrative for everything that \u2019 s going on .\nAnd that \u2019 s just simply not the case .\nWith the over-reliance on climate models , climate dynamics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field .\nYou know , I was old school at the university of Chicago with geophysical fluid dynamics and all this really hard stuff .\nOkay .\nNow people do statistical analyses on climate model output , and we \u2019 ve lost our sense of understanding of how the atmosphere and the ocean interact to produce our climate .\nThere \u2019 s very few universities that have good programs in climate dynamics at this point .\nAnd you don \u2019 t see a lot of students in those research groups , they rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxonomy studies .\nClimate dynamics is still there , but it \u2019 s far from dominant .\nI mean that you geophysical fluid dynamics , clmate dynamics that ruled in the sixties , seventies , eighties , and even into the nineties , but in the 21st century , we \u2019 ve seen that really become like a renascent subfield , with climate model taxonomy ruling the roost .\nChristopher Balkaran : And that taxonomy captivates on the emotional level and allows us to override our ability to be rational and be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with being challenged on this .\nAnd my followup to that is if you \u2019 re president of a university , how do you make sure that climate dynamics is part of your environmental science bachelor \u2019 s degrees and master \u2019 s , Judith Curry : Well , it \u2019 s so low on the totem pole of what people high in higher university administration worry about .\nI mean , you still have like meteorology undergraduates learn about atmospheric dynamics .\nThere aren \u2019 t too many oceanography undergraduate programs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in oceanography , you get a lot of fluid dynamics .\nBut there are all these new degree programs spinning up in climate , that are far away from the geo-physical roots .\nThese new programs combine policy with a little bit of science and economics and whatever .\nAnd then the science part of it basically gets minimized .\nAnd that \u2019 s where all the students are running to these environmental science , climate policy kinds of programs , leaving a talent dearth of people with the good mathematical physical mindset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenging fields .\nSo , these more difficult fields are not especially thriving .\nI mean , they don \u2019 t bring in the big bucks in terms of research centers and whatever .\nIt \u2019 s hard to maintain them .\nA couple of years ago , I visited University of Chicago , my old Alma mater , and they still maintained their very strong focus on the dynamics .\nThere was nobody there running climate models and doing this silly stuff , and they didn \u2019 t have a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly any funding , but they were carrying the torch and doing fantastic work .\nUnfortunately , that \u2019 s not where the that \u2019 s not where the center of mass is \u2013 its in these new climate policy degree programs or environmental studies kind of programs .\nAs a result we \u2019 ve lost a lot of our infusion from physics .\nThere , there still is an infusion from chemistry , more on the atmospheric chemistry .\nPart of this seems to be thriving , relatively relating to air quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThat seems to be thriving .\nBut I would say the more physics based side of all this is really dwindling .\nChristopher Balkaran : And that \u2019 s my worry .\nAs someone whose parents are first-generation immigrants to Canada , education is number one priority .\nThat \u2019 s why so many people from around the world come to North America for education .\nAnd if something as important as climatology is becoming politicized and politically motivated , I worry about that .\nWe \u2019 re training the next set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in atmospheric sciences to be briefing the government .\nAnd that should worry more Americans Canadians as well .\nJudith Curry : Yeah .\nyou know , people have said Trump is anti-science .\nI don \u2019 t think he \u2019 s anti-science , he just doesn \u2019 t pay attention to it .\nWhat he pays attention to is energy policy .\nThis doesn \u2019 t necessarily make you anti-science it makes you ignoring science , so it \u2019 s different .\nSo that \u2019 s what we \u2019 ve seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then we have on the other side of the aisle , politicians say \u201c I believe in science \u201d and they don \u2019 t understand anything about it .\nThey say they believe in it .\nIt \u2019 s like they they \u2019 re believing in Santa Claus .\nit \u2019 s really a political and cultural signifier rather than any real understanding .\nSo it \u2019 s just become so politicized , you know , how do you get around that ?\nHow do you get past that ?\nI don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can you talk about what the Obama administration got wrong in the eight years while they were in power ?\nWhen it comes to climate change ?\nJudith Curry : Okay .\nWell , the first four years , Obama saw that climate change was a political tar baby , and so he pretty much ignored it and went on and tried to do other things where he thought he could be more successful .\nI think that was a good choice .\nHe picked up on climate change in his second term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holdren , his science advisor really politicized it .\nPresident Obama was tweeting about deniers and stuff like that .\nAnd on the White House web page , there was stuff about calling out the climate deniers , and it was very polarizing .\nI think a lot of the polarization that happened in the U S , really accelerated during Obama \u2019 s second term .\nThen you get whiplash with the Trump administration who , doesn \u2019 t care about climate change .\nHe does care about energy policies , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different tangent .\nChristopher Balkaran : So that \u2019 s fascinating .\nWhat I try to do is put the guests in the driver \u2019 s seat .\nIf you were president of the United States what would you say would lead to effective climate policy knowing what you know .\nI wanted to ask you what you saw as effective climate policy and what parties should pursue .\nJudith Curry : Well , first is reduced vulnerability to extreme weather events .\nSecond is like clean up the real pollution , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nYou know , I don \u2019 t see any way to make coal clean .\nI mean , this whole thing about all fossil fuels are terrible .\nSome are much worse than others .\nCoal does so much damage to the environment , strip mining and coal ash and all this other kind of stuff , apart from CO2 emissions .\nGet rid of coal and acknowledge that we need natural gas , at least for awhile .\nAnd then focus on research and development for new energy technologies : next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmission grid , etc..\nThe other thing is managing our water : too little , or too much .\nIf you do these things , you \u2019 re going to improve human wellbeing , regardless of what the climate is doing .\nJudith Curry : The climate is going to change independent of what we do with emissions .\nPeople think climate change equals the CO2 control knob .\nWith that kind of thinking , we \u2019 re bound to be surprised by what happens with the 21st century climate .\nI won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whether something really crazy will happen , or whether it could be relatively benign .\nA lot of people are talking about a solar minimum in the mid to late 21st century that could very well happen and have a significant impact .\nWe just don \u2019 t know .\nThinking that we can control the climate is misguided hubris .\nAnd we need to electrify Africa and we need to help people in South Asia and central America so they \u2019 re not so vulnerable to these extreme weather events , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less vulnerable to these events .\nThese are things I would focus on .\nThis makes much more sense than setting emissions targets and then trying to enforce them .\nThese targets aren \u2019 t going to change the climate on a meaningful time scale .\nIt \u2019 s just going to screw up the economy .\nAnd at the end of the day , it \u2019 s an opportunity loss when we could have spent all that effort doing these other things that would have made a real difference .\nChristopher Balkaran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know that there are there are places like in Canada which I \u2019 m sure it \u2019 s the same in the United States .\nYou know , wind and solar are much easier .\nHydro is much easier .\nBut coal seems the cheapest solution .\nYou can get energy the quickest and perhaps the fastest over large amounts of distance .\nAnd it might be harder for those regions to switch over to something more renewable or less damaging to the environment .\nAnd a lot of people talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be .\nJudith Curry : Well , I think natural gas can do anything that coal is doing .\nSo natural gas is a much cleaner transitional option .\nYou need one or the other in the near term .\nWhen the wind isn \u2019 t blowing and the sun isn \u2019 t shining , you can \u2019 t fire up a nuclear power plant , turn it on and off .\nHaving wind and solar in the mix really means you do need coal or natural gas because you can switch it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind and solar you add , the more reliant you \u2019 re going to be on gas .\nRegarding battery storage , until we get new storage technology , there isn \u2019 t enough lithium in the world for all that storage .\nRethinking and re-engineering the grid could also better redistribute wind and solar generated energy .\nApart from the storage issue , wind and solar use so much land space .\nIt \u2019 s the land use that is bad .\nA nuclear reactor uses tiny fraction of the land space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmental issues related to mining and storage for nuclear power , but those seem to me a lot easier to address than the issues related to wind and solar .\nSo I think on balance , you know , nuclear is probably the best solution based on our current on the near horizon technologies that will be available .\nIt \u2019 s fascinating .\nYou mentioned that land use , because I have another professor from the university of British Columbia coming on the podcast .\nAnd there \u2019 s an article recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about solar farms near their traditional lands that take up the majority of the land .\nAnd the same is true with biofuels and ethanol production .\nThe amount of agriculture that \u2019 s necessary for trucks to be powered by biofuels is , you know , the amount of land that \u2019 s needed is , is quite a bit .\nSo if there \u2019 s negative externalities with this switch , as you just mentioned these are really fascinating thoughts , professor .\nYou know , I love the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world .\nI know Pakistan is going to suffer from severe water shortages over the next 20 to 30 years .\nJudith Curry : The population of Pakistan is exploding .\nRight after the big floods in 2010 my company got involved trying to help Pakistan with flood forecasting and , and water management and whatever .\nAnd my colleague , Peter Webster even went to Pakistan with a delegation from the World Bank , but the whole issue was so politicized as to even who would be allowed to help .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I don \u2019 t think anybody helped .\nWe have a solution , but getting it through the political process and implementing it , was a hopeless situation .\nSo , part of the problems is governance within country .\nAnd this is apart from the issue of financial and somebody coming up with a real solution , but in country governance can be a real impediment in many of these places .\nSo a lot of tough problems out there .\nChristopher Balkaran : And again , if there \u2019 s anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopefully get governments of all different stripes to commit to .\nI mean , that \u2019 s always the ideal .\nBut I think about what we \u2019 re doing on climate change and the Paris accord and do that in the reverse , but on critical real issues Judith Curry : There \u2019 s one example from today in the U.S , they \u2019 re passing the new budget and wanting to get a rider included related to clean energy .\nAnd what they agreed on was an R & D program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kind of stuff .\nAnd the people on the left really objected to it because they don \u2019 t like nuclear just because they don \u2019 t like it .\nAnd they don \u2019 t like carbon capture and storage because that lets the oil companies off the hook .\nSo , so the hard core green activists don \u2019 t like either one of those .\nHere you have a bipartisan agreement to do something that is fundamentally pretty sensible .\nThen you \u2019 ve got the people on the far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and things that just make no sense Christopher Balkaran : Politically , economically or for the environment .\nSo , these , aren \u2019 t the deniers , these are our people on the other side who are putting up the road blocks .\nHow do you break free from that ?\nI have no idea .\nAnd that \u2019 s something that I definitely want to explore with more people .\nIt \u2019 s how did all of a sudden , it seems to me , these groups on the extremes have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , determining whose research gets funded , determine what books make the New York Times Bestseller List .\nI mean , if you really go down the list and you look at all the ways in which media touches us , it \u2019 s largely affected by extremist views more so now than ever before .\nAnd I always wonder , where is that space for rational discourse , which is why I created this podcast , which is to get back to that we need this mind .\nChristopher Balkaran : Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI know this is probably the first of many podcasts because I want to definitely talk to you more about many of the things we \u2019 ve discussed today .\nAnd thank you for , for , for being reasonable , standing up for what you believe in and , you know , trying to spark so many peoples you know , what a lot of people are thinking when it comes to climate change , which is we need more rational discussion on this .", "author": "curryja", "url": "https://judithcurry.com/2021/01/30/interview-climate-change-a-different-perspective-with-judith-curry/", "published": "Sat, 30 Jan 2021

to Climate Neutrality", "content": "Spatial Requirements of Wind/Solar and Nuclear Energy and Their Respective Costs \u201c In addition to the energy sector , the climate debate also needs a transition .\nFrom ideology and wishful thinking , to facts , figures and rationality.\n\u201d An important document was published last week , a collaborative instigated by two members of the European Parliament \u2013 one from the Netherlands and the other from Czechoslovakia .\nOne of the editors on the resulting report is Lucas Bergkamp , who has written several guest posts at Climate Etc .\nThe study is now available for download on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical reality check on the rush to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy .\nA new study on EU climate policy finds that it is practically impossible to generate sufficient energy with wind and solar energy as there is not enough available land to cover all electricity demand .\nThe study , titled \u2019 Road to EU Climate Neutrality by 2050 \u2019 advises the EU to embark on a \u201c Nuclear Renaissance \u201d programme in trying to achieve its climate objectives .\nThe EU has endorsed the ambitious objective of achieving climate neutrality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbon emissions ) by 2050 .\nAn energy transition away from fossil fuels is necessary to achieve this objective .\nThe ECR and the Renew group of the European Parliament have commissioned an independent study into the spatial requirements of wind/solar versus nuclear energy and their respective costs .\nA team of experts came to the conclusion that it is practically impossible to provide enough energy with renewables .\nThe study includes a case study done for two EU member states : The Netherlands , a country along the North Sea with abundant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a landlocked country with no access to sea and a geographical more challenging landscape .\nIn realistic scenarios , there is not enough land to meet all power demand if the Czech Republic and The Netherlands were to rely solely or predominantly on wind and solar power .\nThe study , initiated by Dutch MEP Rob Roos and Czech MEP Ond\u0159ej Knotek and peer-reviewed in part by , among other respected scientists , Nobel Prize-winning economist William Nordhaus , finds that nuclear energy is also more cost-effective than renewables .\nEven if taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wind farms , nuclear energy will remain the cheaper option in 2050 .\nIn this comparison , the enormous costs for adapting the electricity grid , such as connecting wind turbines at sea or solar parks on land , are not even included .\nThat price tag is also invariably lower for nuclear energy .\n\u201c We found it remarkable that \u2013 in transitioning away from fossil fuels \u2013 the EU made a policy decision in favour of renewable energy without considering the relative pros and cons of all carbon-neutral technologies \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : \u201c Nuclear energy is always available , cheaper and saves the landscape .\nMoreover , further research into , for example , the thorium molten salt reactor offers enormous opportunities for our export position .\nLet \u2019 s invest our tax money in that .\n\u201d At the moment , sun and wind energy are being pushed and nuclear energy is being held back .\nThe study contains several policy recommendations for the European Commission to change its approach .\nMr Knotek : \u201c The EU is well invited to create a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation technologies .\nTo this end , the EU should adopt a \u2018 Nuclear Renaissance \u2019 program that places nuclear energy on equal footing with renewable energy .\nThe EU policies today are discriminative when it comes to nuclear energy .\nIt \u2019 s time for all policy makers to live up to the EU principle of technological neutrality \u201d The study also concluded that EU 2050 climate neutrality , if achieved , will likely cause only a very small decrease in the average global atmospheric temperature increase , estimated at between 0.05\u00b0C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than between 0.02\u00b0C and 0.06\u00b0C in 2050 , assuming no carbon leakage occurs .\nElectricity-generating technologies

disagree about climate change .\nThis post provides excerpts of a dialogue between European scholars Andrea Saltelli and Paul-Marie Boulanger .\nThere are some real insights here .\nBut mostly , I like the idea of \u2018 pacated dialogue \u2019 .\nPacated ( a new word for me ) means to make less hostile , peaceful .\nWhen I first started Climate Etc ( over 10 years ago ) , somehow this is what I envisioned \u2013 high-level thinking and civil disagreement ( ha ! )\nI have the permission of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the full chapter can be downloaded here [ Dialogue ] .\nReferences are cited in the full chapter .\nI really enjoyed reading this , I hope you enjoy this as much as I did .\nTwo authors contend here about the urgency of the challenge posed by climate change , and about the different roles of science , policy , media and society in debating how to cope .\nOne contendent argues that science \u2019 s epistemic authority is today staked on a sense of urgency of impending climatic catastrophe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other considers climatic action urgent in view of our responsibility to future generations .\nWhile one contendent considers that an accelerated exit from a fossil fuel dominated energy mix is both unfeasible and undesirable , the other sees it as an objective to pursue with renewed political determination .\nThe authors are linked by common interests , including the analysis of controversies involving science and society .\nWhile they agree on several of their diagnoses , e.g .\non vaccines ( Saltelli and Boulanger 2019 ) , they disagree on climate .\nHow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this disagreement in a style which remains \u2013 to the best of the authors \u2019 capacity \u2013 pacated .\nAS : I take issue with the role of science in the present discussion on the urgency of action on climate .\nScience is here not just providing dispassionate facts .\nAs noted by U. Beck in 1986 : Scientists act as if they held a lease on truth , and they must do this for the outside world , because their entire position depends on it [ \u2026 ] Business , science and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they were not doing what they are doing , that is , changing the conditions of social life and hence making policy by their own means .\n( P. U. Beck 1992 ) This \u2018 making policy by its own means \u2019 is precisely what we see now .\nBy talking about an impending climatic Armageddon , science \u2013 or a large sector of the scientific establishment \u2013 is staking its epistemic authority on climate , thus creating a virtuous image for itself as committed to the saving of the planet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present socio-economic trajectories would lend itself to a more mixed judgment ( Saltelli and Boulanger 2019 ) .\nAs a result , the media thus incited have come to present a series of processes dominated by decadal dynamic ( rise in temperature , in sea level , in frequency and intensity of extreme events ) as having jumped through the roof , as happening here and now .\n[ W ] are told [ by the media ] that \u2018 billions will die \u2019 , the \u2018 world will end in 12 days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of excitement \u2013 not to say war \u2013 on climate is becoming critical .\nIt detracts attention away from other pressing environmental concerns , from the collapse of fisheries to the decline in insects \u2013 not to mention a long list including atmospheric pollution , persistent organic pollutants , endocrine disruptors , and so on .\nThe unfortunate epithet \u2018 denier \u2019 may be applied even to those scientists who do not believe that climate is the most urgent environmental threat \u2013 let alone the economic and geopolitical one , while \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Turner 2015 ) .\nOne needs impeccable ecological credentials to be allowed to say climate is not perhaps the most urgent environmental threat .\nOne of the best-known sociologists of science can be heard declaring his allegiance to the climatic cause and expressing concern about the misuse of his earlier work from deniers .\nThe resemblance of these practices to those of official religion is surprising .\nMore in general , focusing on the \u2018 fear \u2019 of the public for the climatic threat appears a convenient distraction from a rapidly evolving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democratic representation , rising inequality and insurgent populism and nativism ( Saltelli and Boulanger 2019 ) .\nThat policy is being \u2018 distracted \u2019 by climate has been noted , for example , in relation to the G7 meeting in Biarritz of August 2019 , where in spite of work done in Chantilly in July in preparation for the meeting , promising to address \u2018 fairer capitalism \u2019 and inequality , i.e .\neconomic and financial topics befitting the G7 more that global threats , the climate discussion ended up obliterating these important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I distinguish two main questions here , each of them deserving an article of its own .\nThe first question has to do with the relationship between science and politics .\nThe second is the question of what should have priority on the global political agenda .\nA \u201c Long-Term & Society \u201d configuration sees society collapsing in a medium to long future because of its internal contradictions , class struggles or whatever .\n\u201c Short-Term & Environment \u201d gives priority to the current threats to health and well-being arising from pollution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources .\n\u201c Short-Term & Society \u201d focuses on the tensions , inequalities and social contradictions already at work in our society .\nAs advocates of the cultural theory argue , no attitude is necessarily more accurate or legitimate than any other .\nAll are legitimate and necessary in a complex society .\nYet , according to the circumstances , it is possible that one of them becomes prominent for a time because of the necessity to act in a domain that has been hitherto neglected .\nThis , I submit , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate issue .\nI am convinced that as soon as significant advances will have been made towards its control and/or adaptation , the corresponding attitude will recede , leaving the place to another priority , long or short-term , environmental or social .\nThe conclusion of all this is that there is no point in opposing one mode of observation to another .\nNone is inherently more legitimate , more justified than another .\nAs every observation has its unmarked space and its blind spot , no one is complete , totally comprehensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not for long favour one point of view at the expense of the others .\nIt must endeavour to satisfy each of them , at least ( and necessarily ) , partially .\nIf climate activists are shouting so loudly at the moment , it is because they feel that their point of view has been for too long neglected since all the Nation-States of the world have endorsed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , in 1992 .\nThis being said , let us turn to the wide question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and speculate about what has gone wrong in the climate change case .\nParadoxically , in the case of climate change , the relationships between science and policy is very peculiar .\nWhy ?\nBecause of the IPCC ; it is a rather exceptional institution which had ( almost ? )\nno other equivalent in other fields at the moment of its settlement .\nActually , the IPCC is a hybrid of science and policy .\nNow , has science been successful in staking its epistemic authority on climate ?\nI am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no domain has been as fiercely controversial as the climate one , especially the issue of human influence on climate .\nIt is not to be denied that something unfamiliar has happened with climate science and the climate issue .\nWhilst \u201c normal science \u201d conforms traditionally to the ethos described by Robert K. Merton as the conjunction of communism , universalism , disinterestedness , and organized scepticism ( Merton 1973 ) \u2013 an ethos that guarantee its legitimacy and credibility \u2013 climate science , on the contrary , as institutionalized in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stubborn search for consensus , banishing organized scepticism from the scientific arena and leaving room for un-organized scepticism in the media .\nIn some sense , we are here not very far away from what can happen in the religious domain ; the climate-sceptics being considered as heretics and being indicated for disrepute .\nContrary to what happened with the H-Bomb Committee where two rivals labs have been settled and financed on an equal basis ( See Turner ( Turner 2015 ) , Chapter 15 .\n\u201c Expertise in Post-Normal Science \u201d ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a unique scientific ( more exactly , a mix of scientific and administrative ) body devoid of internal mechanisms for competition and contest .\nParadoxically , it could be possible to argue that the IPCC has done more harm than good to climate science and climate change awareness .\nIt seems that the climate issue was less controversial before its inception in 1988 than after .\nOn the other hand , I don \u2019 t think that science has \u201c staked its epistemic authority on climate \u201d .\nThere is no evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded out scientific communications on fisheries , pesticides , and many other environmental issues .\nThe authors in ( Hilgartner and Bosk 1988 ) have cogently compared the public arena to a Darwinian ecosystem where social problems struggle for recognition , only a few of them succeeding in capturing the attention of the political system .\nAs suggested here above , the fact that the IPCC didn \u2019 t provide itself for an internal contradictory debate gave the media an opportunity to organize it itself .\nAs Evelyn Fox Keller notes : \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in their very commitment to the traditional ethic of \u201c balance , \u201d sometimes contribute to the widespread misimpression that climate scientists are deeply divided about both the extent of the dangers we face and the relevance of human activity to global warming.\n\u201d One can regret that the climate issue has overshadowed the theme of sustainable development \u2013 clearly too complex and cumbersome a concept to have a chance to become a suitable theme for the media .\nHowever , it had the merit of putting the whole environmental issue ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other ) on the political agenda and by acknowledging the legitimacy of economic and social concerns with regard to environmental ones , so as to exclude nobody from the debate .\nIn regard to the promises of sustainable development , one can lament over the excessive place climatic concerns have taken today at the expense of others perhaps as urgent and vital environmental issues but this is not a very productive attitude .\nIt is not at all assured that it will help putting these others concerns on the agenda .\nOn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discard absolutely all environmental concerns as the examples of Trump or Bolsonaro illustrate .\nAS : I amicably disagree with your last statement \u2013 as discussed , the point of contention is not presence \u2013 absence on the agenda , but the Darwinian competition for attention in the public sphere .\nAdditionally , while you reproach the media of a false \u2018 balancing \u2019 act , inflating the opinion of doubters \u2013 or \u2018 deniers \u2019 , \u2018 delayers \u2019 , \u2018 contrarians \u2019 , \u2018 confusionists \u2019 , \u2018 lukewarmers \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heat of the confrontation , there are voices which reproach media for being more receptive to Apocalyptic warning of end of mankind than to a reasoned assessment of climate science ( Nisbet 2019 ) ( Shellenberger 2019 ) ( Kloor 2017 ) .\nPMB : I don \u2019 t see the point on which you \u2013 amicably- disagree with me .\nThe Darwinian competition is precisely for a place on the public agenda , taking account of the limited capacity of the public to tackle several issues at once .\nNuanced observers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the former chairman of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research , Mike Hulme , though acknowledging the legitimacy and urgency of the climate change issue , blame the IPCC for having underestimated the autonomy of the political and overestimated the one of science in society .\nBut , as already stated , the IPCC is not THE science of climate .\nIt is an intermediary institution between climate science ( and other things too ) and the unfinished , flawed political system of the world society .\nIts crime is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relationship between science and politics , the \u201c truth speaks to power \u201d model ( S. Beck 2011 ) .\nThe problem is probably here : in our functionally differentiated society , hybridicity is an uncomfortable situation .\nBut we should not throw the baby out with the bath water forgetting that upstream of the IPCC , there are thousands of scientists who are just concerned with finding and communicating the truth , a truth which they know is temporary and incomplete but that , in all honesty , it is their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to communicate .\nThey can not be held responsible for the errors of the IPCC \u2019 s Assessment Reports writers ; if any .\nThe challenge is not to set these concerns against each other , but to show their intertwining , their systemic nature and to adapt our modes of governance accordingly .\nThe fight against climate change is therefore also and perhaps above all a social and political fight .\nAs Greta Thunberg brilliantly put it , she indicts the economic and political elites who consciously let the situation deteriorate ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not know \u201d Chirac said in Johannesburg in 2002 ) .\nWhat I think most shocks the young people who are demonstrating is precisely the gap between the major declarations , the so-called international agreements and the concrete actions .\nIt is the characteristic of youth to think that actions must be in harmony with words .\nAdults have long ago lost any illusion in that respect , in the political sphere , at least .\nThis concerns the main difficulty of environmental policies , the beneficial effects of which will only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term and therefore benefit future generations , while the costs are borne by current generations .\nThe most sophisticated criticisms of sustainable development are that it seeks to achieve intergenerational justice at the cost of injustice to the poorest of the current generations .\nAnd it is obviously a risk , unless public policy instruments are used that place the burden on the most advantaged .\nAS : I believe that one should carefully balance the inertia of the elites with the nature of the demands posed by climate activists .\nThe demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from fossil fuel can not be met without changing our pattern of consumption , lest we meet the same fate of the German Energiewende \u2013 whereby the more solar and wind power is installed , the more carbon must be burned to offset the intermittency of renewable energies ( Renner and Giampietro 2020 ) .\nThese failures have recently led to disillusionment .\nTo give an example , the failure of Energiewende can be blamed \u2013 for some commentators , on a too hastily exit from the German nuclear ( Seneviratne 2019 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upholders of the Ecomodernist Manifesto , is tireless in its advocacy of nuclear as the only way to ensure a carbon neutral future , just glance to the Energy section of their online presence at https : //thebreakthrough.org/energy .\nIn more general terms I see the following paradox at play : a swift transition is being asked from governments \u2013 whose elites are charged with inaction .\n[ W ] e are locked by our own pattern of consumption .\nPMB : It is clear that we are stuck in our consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but above all by infrastructure and buildings that were designed and built at a time when the climate issue was not yet an issue .\nThe question of the transition to a low-carbon economy has , in my opinion , been dealt with in the most rational way by researchers at the Rotterdam DRIFT , adopting an approach focusing on the intermediate level of the socio-technological systems of energy , mobility , housing , etc .\nThis transition must use many and varied instruments : economic , technological , socio-cultural .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology is not necessarily \u201c more of the same \u201d .\nAS : Well , I hope I have shown that this is unfeasible in the stipulated time windows , both technically and economically .\nAs per the political will , this is not just the will of politicians , but of their constituencies who are not ready to withstand a change of lifestyle .\nNot all scientists share this \u2018 can do \u2019 euphoria .\nBritish scientists point out that the UK electric car target for 2050 collide with a physical impossibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times the current total annual world cobalt production , nearly the entire world production of neodymium , three quarters of that of lithium production and at least half of that of copper ( Editors 2019a ) .\nIn order to keep the attention of the citizenry focused on the climate battle , a \u2018 can do \u2019 attitude is being held , offering simplistic images of an economy which can be made circular , or rapidly decarbonized , against historical evidence of past transformations .\nMathematical models are shown as capable of predicting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draughts up to the year 2050 or 2100 .\nProblematic quantifications play a key role in these narratives .\nFor the authors in ( Renner and Giampietro 2020 ) the low carbon narrative of the European Commission is simultaneously heroic and reductionist .\nThese authors deploy tools from relational biology and societal metabolism to identify physical infeasibilities , economic non-viability and \u2013 to conclude , dubious social desirability of what would be needed to equip Europe to deal with renewable intermittent energy sources reliant on wind and solar within a few decades .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this analysis identifies in the problem of energy storage , in the monetary costs , and in the greenhouse gas externalities associated with the creation and use of batteries the existing bottlenecks which prevent a plausible rapid way out of carbon by adoption of intermittent renewable sources \u2013 in contrast to the domination narrative and promises .\nThese authors confirm the implausibility ( for lack of natural resources ) of a Lithium based storage system even at the level of a single country , and note how European leaders can not simultaneously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emissions and ( b ) to scale-up the supply of intermittent sources of electricity ( wind- and solar-based ) to obtain a significant decarbonization of European economies within two or three decades , as the construction of the new infrastructure and storage will in all likelihood more than double the emission during the transition period .\nThe concept that more renewable installed capacity will automatically lead to a new greener future \u2013 in the absence of a parallel societal change of institutional regimes and patterns of consumption , clashes against historical records that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conventional ( fossil ) energy production .\nAS : There can be little doubt that science has played a very active role in putting climate change at the top of the policy agenda on a planetary scale .\nIs this priority and urgency justified ?\nAre we right in moving from concern to alarm ?\nShould we panic as suggested by a passionate young activist ( Greta Thunberg 2019 ) ?\nPMB : Now , panic is never a good counsellor .\nHowever , Thunberg \u2019 s call for panic is understandable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available at the end of the seventies and that even Georges Bush ( the father ) was very close to take measures that would have helped avoiding any panic or hysteria today .\nWhat Nathaniel Rich demonstrates when he says that everything we understand about global warming was understood in 1979 is that we have been very close to a scientific AND political consensus already in the early eighties .\nThe problem is that despite all these treaties and repeated commitments , nothing significant has ever been done .\nNo wonder the population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no wonder young people get outraged by the casual attitude of these leaders towards the fundamental conditions of trust : that the words we use and the words we utter have meaning .\nAS : None of us can be an expert in this immense field .\nComparing facts is undoubtedly useful , but here we are comparing how us , two different scientists , have come to assimilate their knowledge into an opinion about what should be done , in the hope that something we say may resonate with our readers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coming back to the climate of emergency on climate \u2013 pun intended , why do I find it counterproductive ?\nIn intimating to be scared Greta Thunberg calls for what Hans Jonas called the hermeneutics of fear \u2013 the idea of fear as a paradoxically maximizing energy .\nAgainst this moral \u2018 maximalism of climate emergency \u2019 an appeal to the classical virtues of prudence and phronesis appear in order .\nThe French philosopher Pascal Bruckner shares this vision : \u201c The idea that decarbonizing economies will be a long and tortuous process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore makes more sense than thundering declarations , is totally unacceptable to the prophets of the coming Apocalypse .\nWhereas ecology demands policies that actually work , that take into account the human costs of transition , and that do nothing to harm the poorest among us , they prefer aggressive fanaticism.\n\u201d PMB : Greta Thunberg and other whistle-blowers are just the tip of the iceberg .\nAS : I am sure that the comparison has been made by others between Greta and Joan of Arc .\nIn both cases the appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their moral stature is \u2013 in a sense , beyond criticism , surely above the non-edifying noise originating from the present contention .\nIn both cases we see \u2018 sanctity \u2019 of a sort at play .\n[ B ] oth Church and Science have promoted causes which in retrospect we have come to condemn .\nI stand by my opinion that science can not prove that climate is more urgent than the Gaza strip , or an incumbent new war in the Gulf , or insectageddon , or too-big-to-fail banks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem engaged in trying to do precisely that .\nPMB : I agree with you on that .\nIt is a thing science can \u2019 t prove .\nIt is up to each of us , as citizens , with multiple diplomas or illiterate , to form an opinion based on the information available and our hierarchy of values .\nHowever , when you take care of , for instance , what happens in the Gaza strip you can benefit the population living there ( but perhaps only a part of it ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change you benefit populations all over the world including of course the one living in the Gaza strip , and this whatever their standing in the conflict .\nClimate change , more than any other environmental global issue , gives us an opportunity , for the first time in history , to have all nations in the world united in a common endeavour , beyond all that opposes them besides , as is the case in the Gaza strip .\nWhat is the role of public intellectuals and politicians in this discussion ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is not convinced that climate poses the most urgent threat to mankind , and the patent institutional failures to address the climate threat are presented as a symptom of the deterioration of our global political systems .\nThus , the tones of the debate have escalated .\nFor New York Times columnist Timothy Snyder ( Snyder 2012 ) climate scepticism is a crime against humanity comparable to the Nazi exterminations of innocent children .\nPaul Krugman deplores the \u2018 depravity \u2019 of climate deniers ( Krugman 2018 ) , while Vandana Shiva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others intellectual sign an open letter calling for citizens to rise up and organise for the climate \u2018 emergency \u2019 .\nAs discussed in relation to green taxes on fuel , to use a form of taxation which hits the poor more than the rich to fix the environment appears to many protesters as the ultimate effrontery of the elites .\nThis new phenomenon of protest \u2013 which appears to pit the aspirations of the have against the needs of the have-not , takes place after Brexit and the election of Donald Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a surprise to the same elites , and new media have played a role in all , offering an example of the interplay between techno-science on the one hand and policy and society on the other ( Saltelli and Boulanger 2019 ) .\nIn relation to climate , a majority of the progressive believe that a climate-dominated agenda , as the Green New Deal is the US , is the best strategy to fight populism and authoritarianism .\nPerhaps they could follow the pope in not ignoring \u201c social justice \u201d .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ through an ethical one .\nThis means that social justice includes environmental justice .\nIn this regard , the attractiveness of the idea of sustainable development as articulated in the Brundtland Report is to be rediscovered .\nIn my opinion , except for the population issue , \u201c Laudato Si \u201d is the best articulation of the sustainable development ideal since the Brundtland Report .\nI don \u2019 t see where the Green New Deal of US democrats is oblivious of social justice .\nPersonally , what I am more afraid of is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political climato-socialism oblivious of civil liberties .\nNow , you ask what is the role of the public intellectual ?\nI think it is to do exactly what we are doing here : communicating open mindedly with one another , exchanging arguments and only arguments , not insults and without impugning motives , in order to help the people who hear or read us to make their mind in the most rational way .\nAnd then , let anybody act personally in accordance with his-her conscience and let the political democratic procedures and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collectively .\nAS : Gro Harlem Brundtland , the UN Secretary-General \u2019 s Special Envoy on Climate Change , is rightly remembered for the words : \u201c Doubt has been eliminated \u201d .\nThe words were uttered in 2007 at a speech before the United Nations .\nIn a Greta-ante-litteram style , she went on to say \u201c It is irresponsible , reckless and deeply immoral to question the seriousness of the situation.\n\u201d This intimation put Brundtland in trouble with the Norwegian Research Ethics Committee for Science and Technology ( NENT ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violated the principles of research ethics , in particular academic freedom , anti-dogmatism and organized skepticism .\nNENT blandly reminded Brundtland that what she said did not amount to \u2018 scientific language \u2019 but it was considered that hers was a political \u2013 as opposed to scientific \u2013 speech , be it that she based her arguments on one of IPCC reports ( AR4 ) and on the Stern review on the Economics of Climate Change .\nI recall this episode here as it is instructive of how public intellectuals mobilize science \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in society , this role entails .\nAs noted by Strand , a science-based life-philosophy can not derive authority from science itself .\nOf course the sin of former prime minister of Norway \u2013 a politician after all , pale before the texts of the scientists / activists such as Naomi Klein ( latest book : On Fire : The ( Burning ) Case for a Green New Deal ) and Bill McKibben ( latest work : Falter : Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out ? )\n.\nI hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the limits of the IPCC reporting , we have today a problem with science itself .\nWhat will a future historian say ?\nAS : Take a future historian looking at the XXI century \u2013 plagued as it was by a rather normal mix of wars , social and environmental catastrophes , augmented by a rather aggressive season of technological disruptions .\nThis historian might look with puzzlement at humans electing the greenhouse effect as the existential threat of the epoch .\nShe will be studying mathematical models as her predecessors studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be read as confessions of an epoch \u2019 s unspoken metaphors and zeitgeist .\nShe will be surprised by model-based cost benefit analysis of climate impact .\nExistential threats , after all , are not counted in monetary numeraires .\nYet she knows that each epoch is paradoxical in its own specific way .\nPMB : What about a future historian ( if it exists at all ) looking with puzzlement at humans of the XXI century who whilst having all the information concerning the risks of climate change decided to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European as well now , with our new EC ) way of life is not negotiable \u201d ?\nAS : We are divided by the relative balance of what we resent ; I resent Europeans marching against climate while Erdogan marches against Kurds .\nBy the time this dialogue has been written , the signals of a shifting geopolitical landscape have multiplied , and I resent scientists \u2019 role in forcing us to look elsewhere .\nI suspect that the climatic day of reckoning is an idol in the Baconian sense , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present by projecting the threat into a convenient not-so-close-to-affect-me future .\nInstead of acting as nourishment for a deeper ecological sensitivity it boxes ecological problem into a single planetary container , where an odourless and colourless gas slowly increases the temperature of the planet .\nThis idol risks subtracting energies from the fight against the messier aspects of our impact on the planet , let alone a disturbing social and geopolitical transient .\nScience is thus contributing to a hiatus which is likely to alienate from science a majority .\nThis is regrettable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool , and leaving it as the preserve of the elites , as predicted by the so-called techno-spit scenario , is dystopian .\nIn this scenario one would be left with an affluent super-technological and possibly trans-human/immortal minority , and a useless , confused and distracted majority left glued to its mobile phones and tablets .\nBefore leaving the word to Paul-Marie for his final comment , I wish to report a personal episode which perhaps adds to the reason why a civilized dialogue as the present one is necessary .\nRecently la @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by copies sold , attacked L \u2019 Accademia dei Lincei ( usually abridged to The Lincei , plural , \u2018 Those who see far \u2019 ) , arguably the most venerable Italian academy .\nThe title of La Repubblica was \u2018 The Lincei organize a workshop on climate , and give the floor to denier Battaglia \u2019 ( my translation ) .\nBattaglia is an Italian professor faulted by La Repubblica for having attacked Greta .\nThe article also noted that one of the organizers resigning in protest for this presence .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the invitees ) listed 14 talks and eight poster presentations .\nOnly one talk , signed by eight authors , and entitled \u201c Critical considerations regarding the anthropogenic global warming theory \u201d included the aforementioned professor .\nA few days after the article , the academy cancelled the event , thus offering the opportunity to journals of different orientation , which accused The Lincei of censoring dissent .\nThe intellectual suicide of The Lincei poses ethical problems and vindicates the existence of a science police , whereby \u201c On highly charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endangered species , peer review literature and public discourse are aggressively patrolled by self-appointed sheriffs in the scientific community \u201d .\nPMB : In both camps , you will find excessive , irrational , even neurotic people and statements .\nFor me , it doesn \u2019 t prove anything .\nIt is never the ones who shout the louder who are right .\nThese are just the skum of the wave , the tip of the iceberg .\nWhat matters is the wave , the hidden part of the iceberg .\nThe question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but of the kind and-and .\nAs I tried to argue at the very first of our discussion , a complex world doesn \u2019 t need simplistic and one-sided views but combinations of long term and short term , society and nature \u2019 s oriented , perspectives .\nClimate change is only one of the many dimensions of the current socio-political-ecological crisis we are facing now , as part of a human species gone mad by hubris .\nThere are certainly lessons to be drawn from what happened with the climate issue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the political one .\nI think the first should have refrained from mixing itself too closely with the second in the IPCC and kept its full autonomy .\nConversely , the second should have endorsed the full responsibility of the collective treatment of the question without putting itself under the authority of science .\nWe see this has been deleterious for both systems and therefore for society as a whole .\nJC remarks :

change on hurricanes .\nInsurance industry clients of my company , Climate Forecast Applications Network ( CFAN ) , have requested a critique of this report .\nAIR Worldwide , a respected catastrophe risk modeling and consulting company , has recently published a report Quantifying the Impact from Climate Change on Hurricane Risk .\nAIR \u2019 s assessment has three components : The AIR Report purports to \u201c capture the full range of plausible events that could impact an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hazard component .\nA summary of my analysis is provided below : \u2022 The driver for AIR \u2019 s assessment is warming associated with the emissions/concentration scenario RCP8.5 , which AIR refers to as a \u2018 business as usual scenario.\n\u2019 In fact , RCP8.5 is increasingly being judged as implausible by energy economists , and is not recommended for use in policy planning .\n\u2022 The hurricane risk from climate change focuses on the number and intensity of U.S. landfalls in a changing climate .\nTheir scenario of the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is judged to be implausible for medium emissions scenarios such as RCP4.5 .\n\u2022 The sea level scenarios used in the AIR Report are higher than the recent IPCC consensus assessments and are arguably implausible for medium emissions scenarios .\n\u2022 The AIR Report ignores the \u2018 elephant in the room \u2019 that is of relevance to their target period to 2050 : the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation ( AMO ) .\nA shift to the cool phase of the AMO would arguably portend fewer major hurricanes striking the U.S. For reference on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate change , see these reports recently published by CFAN : When considering scenarios of future climate change , there is much scope for uncertainty .\nPlausible outcomes ( especially on the high end ) are weakly constrained and there is much disagreement among experts as to the likely range of outcomes ( 67 % likelihood ) .\nOutcomes of future climate change are associated with deep uncertainty [ for further context , see my paper on Climate Uncertainty and Risk ] .\nUnder conditions of deep uncertainty , probabilities of outcomes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can hope to plausibly bound the range of outcomes .\nThe IPCC seeks to bound the likely range [ 67 % ] of outcomes .\nThis classification is used here in evaluating the plausibility of AIR \u2019 s scenarios out to 2050 .\nAIR \u2019 s assessment of the climate change impact on U.S. hurricane risk is driven solely by warming from manmade emissions .\nSpecifically , the AIR Report focuses on emission/concentration scenario RCP8.5 .\nWhile the emissions/concentration scenario RCP8.5 is often referred to as a \u2018 business as usual \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extreme scenario that is implausibly high .\nRCP8.5 pathways are driven by : very high population growth , very high energy intensity of the economy , low technology development , and a high level of coal in the energy mix .\nWang et al .\n( 2017 ) and Ritchie and Dowlatabadi ( 2018 ) challenge the bullish expectations for coal in the RCP8.5 scenarios , which is counter to recent global energy outlooks and exceeds today \u2019 s known conventional reserves .\nBurgess et al .\n( 2020 ) further highlight the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contradictions in the assumptions used in constructing the scenario .\nPielke and Ritchie ( 2020 ) concluded that RCP8.5 is systematically misused in applications of climate model simulations , particularly for policy making purposes .\nRitchie and Dowlatabadi ( 2018 ) recommend that RCP8.5 not be used as a benchmark for policy studies .\nThe 2019 World Energy Outlook Report from the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) challenges the near-term RCP scenario projections through 2040 [ link ] .\nThe IEA examined three scenarios : a current policy scenario where no new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries ; a stated policies scenario where Paris Agreement commitments are met ; and a sustainable development scenario where rapid mitigation limits late 21st century warming to well below 2\u00b0C .\nThe IEA projections through 2040 are close to the RCP4.5 scenario ( a moderate emissions scenario ) and much lower than for RCP8.5 . )\nOn timescales to 2050 , I would classify RCP8.5 as implausible and RCP4.5 as the likely scenario .\nIn terms of a plausible worst case emissions/concentration scenario to 2050 , the forthcoming IPCC AR6 is also using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , given that likely projections of emissions out to 2050 are plausibly close to RCP4.5 , it arguably makes more sense to use your one \u2018 borderline implausible \u2019 assumptions on future hurricane activity and sea level rise under the RCP4.5 scenario .\nThe significance of rejecting the RCP8.5 in projections of insured losses out to 2050 is this .\nAny changes to hurricane activity that are dependent on increasing sea surface temperatures would be substantially muted ( relative to RCP8.5 ) .\nMore significantly , the greatest uncertainties in 21st century sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large instabilities in the West Antarctic ice sheet arising from the highest temperature projections driven by RCP8.5 .\nBy eliminating RCP8.5 , the highest sea level rise projections are eliminated .\nProblems with the RCP8.5 scenario have been discussed in numerous posts at my blog Climate Etc.\n, with references to the primary literature as well as background information : \u2022 Hausfather and Peters : Emissions- \u2018 the business as usual \u2019 is misleading \u2022 Hausfather and Peters : RCP8.5 is a problematic scenario for long-term emissions \u2022 Pielke Jr and Ritchie : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Assessment \u2022 Burgess et al .\n: IPCC baseline scenarios have over-projected CO2 emissions and economic growth \u2022 Ritchie and Dowlatabadi : Defining climate change scenario characteristics with a phase space of cumulative and carbon intensity .\nWith regards to the amount of warming associated with different emissions scenarios , projections from the CMIP5 climate models are provided in the table below [ from IPCC AR5 Table SPM.2 ] .\nSubstantially more warming is produced by the RCP8.5 scenario relative to RCP4.5 .\nThe range in the projections for a given RCP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate models to warming from increasing emissions ( primarily CO2 ) .\nIt is important to understand that the temperature projections provided by the IPCC ( from the CMIP climate model simulations ) are not predictions of actual outcomes .\nRather , they should be regarded as sensitivity analyses relative to increasing emissions .\nThese projections neglect any changes in natural climate variability that would influence actual climate outcomes in the 21st century .\nWhen considering scenarios of natural climate variability for the 21st century , there are reasons for thinking that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warming for the 21st century , even for the more plausible RCP4.5 emissions scenario : \u2022 Observed warming for the past two decades is less than the average rate of warming simulated by climate models .\n[ link ] \u2022 The ensemble of CMIP5 climate models do not sample the full range of likely values of equilibrium climate sensitivity to increasing CO2 , neglecting the lowest 20 % of the likely range from the IPCC AR5 .\n[ link ] \u2022 Climate model projections do not include solar variability and volcanic eruptions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect in the 21st century .\n[ link ] Specifically considering the amount of warming associated with the RCP4.5 scenario , my assessment is that temperature change is very unlikely to exceed the upper bound of the IPCC AR5 likely range .\nIt is noted here that the CMIP6 temperature projections for the forthcoming IPCC AR6 are coming in warmer than CMIP5/AR5 , with about half of the models having very high sensitivity to CO2 .\nIt will be interesting to see how the AR6 evaluates this .\nTopic for a blog post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sophisticated method to select scenarios from 100,000 stochastic simulations of individual hurricane seasons .\nBy 2050 , AIR predicts a 15 % increase of Cat 3 , a 25 % increase in Cat 4 and a 35 % increase in Cat 5 ( Cat 1 and 2 numbers are unchanged ) .\nNot only does the AIR projection result in an increased proportion of major hurricanes , but also an increase in the total number of major hurricanes .\nIt is difficult to decipher exactly how these numbers were determined .\nFigure 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Figure 7 from the GFDL statement .\nGFDL \u2019 s text accompanying their Figure 7 is cited below : \u201c The Bender et al .\n( 2010 ) study projected a significant increase ( +90 % ) in the frequency of very intense ( category 4 and 5 ) hurricanes using the CMIP3/A1B 18-model average climate change projection .\nSubsequent downscaled projections using CMIP5 multi-model scenarios ( RCP4.5 ) as input ( Knutson et al .\n2013 ) still showed increases in category 4 and 5 storm frequency ( Fig .\n7 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marginally significant for the early 21st century ( +45 % ) or the late 21st century ( +39 % ) CMIP5 scenarios ( based on model versions GFDl and GFDN combined ) .\nThat study also downscaled ten individual CMIP3 models in addition to the multi-model ensemble , and found that three of ten models produced a significant increase in category 4 and 5 storms , and four of the ten models produced at least a nominal decrease .\nWhile multi-model ensemble results are probably more reliable than individual model results , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewed as at least plausible at this time .\nBased on Knutson et al .\n( 2013 ) and a survey of subsequent results by other modeling groups , at present we have only low confidence for an increase in category 4 and 5 storms in the Atlantic ; confidence in an increase in category 4 and 5 storms is higher at the global scale.\n\u201d The AIR Report cited a recent publication by Kossin et al .\n( 2020 ) which provides an analysis of satellite-derived intensities of global tropical cyclones for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided into two periods : Early ( 1979-1997 ) and Late ( 1998-2017 ) .\nThe paper \u2019 s key result is that there is greater probability of a tropical cyclone reaching major hurricane status ( Pmaj ) in the Late versus the Early period , reflecting a global average increase of about 5 % per decade .\nWhen broken down by individual ocean basin regions , this increase is driven by the North Atlantic , the South Pacific and South Indian Oceans .\nNotably , the West Pacific ( the region with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a substantial decrease in the probability of reaching a major hurricane .\nShown below is the main table from Kossin et al .\n( 2020 ; a corrigenda to this table in the original

report concluded that 2oC of warming ( consistent with RCP4.5 in 2100 , or RCP8.5 at mid-century ) is projected to impact hurricane frequency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurricane intensity ( maximum wind speed ) , there is medium-to-high confidence that the global average will increase .\nThe median projected increase in lifetime maximum surface wind speeds is about 5 % ( range 1\u201310 % ) .\n\u2022 For the global proportion of hurricanes that reach Category 4\u20135 levels , there is at least medium-to-high confidence in an increase , with a median projected change of +13 % .\nAuthor opinion in Knutson et al .\n( 2019b ) was more mixed and confidence levels lower for the following projections : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as projected in most studies \u2022 An increase in the global number of very intense hurricanes ( Cat 4\u20135 ) .\nThe Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation ( AMO ) has a strong influence on Atlantic hurricane activity , particularly the number of major hurricanes .\nSince 1995 , the AMO has been in a warm phase ( associated with elevated Atlantic hurricane activity . )\nThe previous cool phase of the AMO ( 1970-1994 ) was associated with few major hurricanes .\nThe previous warm phase ( 1926-1969 ) was also associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ althought sea surface temperatures were substantially cooler than the present warm phase of the AMO .\n[ For further information , see section 4.3.1 from my Report on Hurricanes and Climate Change ] .\nBy looking at the period from 1979-2017 , you can see an obvious and large increase in the number of major hurricanes ( which was

was at least as large as the recent numbers which occurred in the presence of significantly lower sea surface temperatures .\nSimply extrapolating the trend from 1979-2017 ( and assuming it was caused

2020 .\nAs I wrote then , the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden is of great interest , as it is one of very few advanced nations where no lockdown order that heavily restricted people \u2019 s movements and other basic freedoms was imposed .\nUnfortunately , some of the comment on how the COVID-19 epidemic has developed in Sweden has been ill-informed .\nIndeed , a shadowy group of academics , opinion leaders , researchers and others who are upset about Sweden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to influence it has been unmasked .\nThey have been coordinating efforts to criticize media coverage of Sweden \u2019 s strategy and to damage both the image of Sweden abroad and the reputation of individuals who work in this field .\nI present here updated plots of weekly new cases and deaths , with accompanying comments .\n[ 1 ] \u2022 Despite Swedish Covid cases falling to low levels in the summer , they resurged in the autumn \u2022 This second wave , which was very likely a seasonal effect , now appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East Sweden were high in the first wave and low in the second ; for South Sweden the opposite is true .\nThis suggests that population immunity and/or the remaining number of frail old people are key factors in the severity of the second wave .\n\u2022 Excess deaths in Sweden to end 2020 were modest , particularly for 2019 ( when deaths were abnormally low ) and 2020 combined .\nThey appear to be much lower relative to the population than in England , despite far harsher restrictions being imposed there .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 deaths in Sweden were of people aged under 60 Overall development of the epidemic Figure 1 shows the overall picture for confirmed weekly total new COVID-19 cases , intensive care admissions and deaths in Sweden , up to data released on 9 February 2021 .\nThe criteria for testing were widened during the early months , so case numbers up to June 2020 are not comparable with subsequent ones .\nWeekly new cases have been divided by 50 in order to make their scale comparable to that for ICU admissions and deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks will be noticeably understated due to delays in death registrations .\nIn late summer 2020 it looked as if the epidemic had burnt itself out , however a strong second wave developed during September to December .\nAlthough start of school and university term , along with more relaxed behaviour , may have started the second wave off , over the period as a whole the primary driver was almost certainly a seasonal increase in the virus \u2019 s transmission and hence reproduction number .\nStudies that indicated a lack of substantial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 ] have been proven wrong .\nThe changing age composition of new cases over time is shown in Figure 2 .\nCase numbers before and after June 2020 are not comparable because of the major widening of testing during June 2020 .\nHowever , it is clear that the second wave has been dominated by infections of people aged 10 to 59 years .\nAfter falling to very low levels in late July 2020 , weekly COVID-19 recorded deaths rose strongly from late October on , across all age groups ( Figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of people with confirmed COVID-19 who died , regardless of the cause of death .\nIn total , about 50 % of deaths occurred up to and after 30 September 2020 , that is in the first wave and in the second wave ( which is , however , not over yet ) .\nDuring the second wave , a slightly higher proportion of deaths have been of people aged 80+ years than in the first wave .\nI turn now to regional analysis .\nFigure 4 shows weekly confirmed new cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweden .\nAlthough widening of testing ( mainly in the second quarter of 2020 ) varied between regions , it is evident that Stockholm and V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland , which dominated cases during the first wave , were also two of the three regions dominating the second wave , with Stockholm region leading both waves .\nHowever , while Sk\u00e5ne had relatively few first wave cases , it broadly matched Stockholm in the second wave , albeit with a delay .\nCases have fallen quite sharply in almost all regions since the turn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so confirmed cases per 100,000 head of population give a better picture of relative disease incidence ( Figure 5 ) .\nThere is negligible correlation between the regions that had the highest incidence of COVID-19 cases during the first wave ( including or excluding June to August ) and the post-September 2020 period .\nIn the absence of growing population immunity having an effect , one might expect that in those regions in which the virus spread most easily prior to September 2020 ( by which time it was well ensconced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to greater urbanisation \u2013 it would also have spread most easily in the second wave , in the absence of changes in other factors .\nA lack of correlation between cases in the first and second waves is consistent with greater population immunity in those regions that were harder hit in the first wave counteracting , during the second wave , the greater ease with which infections spread there when population immunity was low .\nWeekly COVID-19 confirmed cases per 100,000 head of population by region in Sweden As for cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship across regions between COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 people in the first and the second waves , and the correlation between them is negligible .\nThe non-identity between recorded COVID-19 deaths and those actually caused by the disease may be one reason for this .\nA somewhat clearer picture comes from examining weekly excess deaths in geographical super-regions , as shown in a recent Swedish report .\n[ 4 ] Fig .\n6 Weekly deaths ( purple line ) up to week 3 of 2021 in Sweden compared with the expected normal death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its 95 % confidence interval ( dashed green line ) Figure 6 shows the position for Sweden as a whole .\nData go up to week 3 2021 ; data for more recent weeks are incomplete .\nPeak excess deaths were higher in the first wave than in the second wave , the opposite relationship to that for recorded COVID-19 deaths .\nWhile this likely partly reflects an element of undercounting of deaths caused by COVID-19 at the peak of the first wave , it appears to be mainly due more to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the second wave .\nWhile the second wave is not over yet , it does appear that excess deaths have peaked .\nFigure 7 shows deaths for East Sweden , the population of which is dominated by Stockholm region .\nExcess deaths in the first COVID-19 wave were further above normal than for Sweden as a whole , but excess deaths during the second wave peaked at a level not much above that in the 2017/18 flu and pneumonia season , and fell back within the 95 % confidence interval by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to normal for Stockholm region alone ) .\nAs Figure 6 but for East Sweden ( Stockholm , Uppsala , S\u00f6dermanland , \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland , \u00d6rebro , V\u00e4stmanland ) However , in Southern Sweden , the picture is quite different ( Figure 8 ) , with the second wave of COVID-19 excess deaths being considerably larger than the first , which was smaller than in the 2017/18 flu season .\nFig .\n8 As Figure 6 but for South Sweden ( J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping , Kronoberg , Kalmar , Gotland , Blekinge , Sk\u00e5ne , Halland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Sweden is dominated by that of V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland in the north west and Sk\u00e5ne in the south , which contain respectively Sweden \u2019 s second and third largest cities ( Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6 ) .\nIn southernmost Sweden , the first wave barely breached the upper bound of the 95 % confidence interval for normal deaths , while peak excess deaths in the second wave were three times that level ( Figure 9 ) .\nIn the remainder of South Sweden , excess deaths in the second peaked at a broadly similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The same is true for North Sweden , which is relatively sparsely populated and has few sizeable cities .\nAs Figure 8 but for southernmost Sweden ( Blekinge , Sk\u00e5ne ) alone In my view , the pattern of excess deaths in waves one and two in Stockholm-dominated East Sweden , compared to that in other parts of Sweden , suggests that much of the pool of people in East Sweden vulnerable to dying from COVID-19 had already succumbed by the end of wave one .\nOn the other hand , although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immunity in Stockholm region at the end of wave one was more than adequate to inhibit large scale spread of COVID-19 during the summer , at the level of population mixing occurring then , with hindsight it was at that stage clearly insufficient to provide herd immunity in the winter , when transmission is higher , causing both the virus \u2019 s reproduction number ( R ) and the herd immunity threshold to rise .\n[ 5 ] Although it is too early to be certain , at present it appears that population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a whole is now adequate to prevent large-scale COVID-19 epidemic growth even in winter , at least at the current level of population mixing .\nHowever , there is a caveat in that the B.1.1.77 ( UK-discovered ) variant , which is estimated to be about one-third more transmissible [ 6 ] \u2013 and hence faster growing \u2013 only became apparent in Sweden during December .\nWhile present in 35 % of all Swedish sequenced genomes during the first three weeks of 2021 , it is not yet dominant , so transmission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieves dominance over the next two or three months .\nSweden had 10,082 deaths with confirmed COVID-19 infection for the 53 reporting weeks of 2020 , ending 3 January 2021 , including those reported subsequently .\n[ 7 ] On another measure [ 8 ] , there were 9,432 deaths .\nOnly 0.9 % of deaths were of people under 50 years old , and only 3 % were of under 60 year olds .\nPeople over 70 years old accounted for over 91 % of COVID-19 deaths .\nThe definition of COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to over count deaths caused by COVID-19 , since where there are multiple causes contributing to a death clinically-compatible with COVID-19 ( normally respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome ) it will be recorded as a death due to COVID-19 where SARS-CoV-2 infection is confirmed or suspected , even if COVID-19 is not considered to be the main cause of death .\n[ 9 ] Moreover , some countries have adopted even more over-pessimistic definitions of COVID-19 deaths .\nOthers have likely undercounted COVID-19 deaths .\nAnd in many countries some deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the epidemic were probably not recognised as being such .\nTherefore , excess mortality over a normal level is usually thought to be the best measure of deaths due to COVID-19 .\nExcess mortality is primarily affected by the severity of respiratory disease ( mainly influenza ) winter seasons .\nA severe flu season , which may be caused by a new influenza virus strain , results in many more very frail unhealthy old people dying than a mild flu season .\nSevere flu seasons may occur in pairs in adjoining years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new strain .\nIt follows that , other things being equal , fewer deaths will tend to occur in a flu season that follows a severe flu season , even more so where that is the second of a pair of severe flu seasons , as there will be fewer than normal very old and frail people alive .\nCorrespondingly , more deaths than usual will tend to occur in a season following one or more mild flu seasons .\nThis is known as the \u201c dry tinder \u201d effect .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that across 32 European countries there is a significant negative correlation ( \u20130.63 ) between flu intensity in winter 2018/19 and 2019/20 combined and the COVID-19 mortality rate in the first wave ( Figure 10 ) .\n[ 10 ] Sweden had unusually low mortality in 2019 , which is largely a reflection of mild late 2018/19 and early 2019/20 flu seasons ( the early and late part of each flu season falling in different calendar years ) .\nIt thus had higher than usual \u201c dry tinder \u201d when the COVID-19 epidemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danish researcher of the influence of \u201c dry tinder \u201d in Sweden , published by a US economic research institute , concluded that it accounted for many COVID-19 deaths .\n[ 11 ] Similarly , an analysis by an economics researcher at a US university [ 12 ] , which looked at 15 factors apart from severity of government interventions that might explain the higher COVID-19 deaths in Sweden than in other Nordic countries , concluded that the \u201c dry tinder \u201d factor was the most significant one .\nThat paper also considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government interventions accounted for only a small part of Sweden \u2019 s higher Covid death rate than in other Nordic countries .\nDeath rate from COVID-19 up to 10 June 2020 by total 2-year flu intensity for 32 countries .\nThe R2 of 0.396 ( r=\u22120.63 ) is significant at the 1 % level .\nA reproduction of Figure 1 in reference 10 .\nA fair estimate of excess deaths in Sweden caused by COVID-19 in 2020 should reflect the unusually large number of very old and frail people who survived 2019 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and predicted deaths for 2019 and 2020 combined .\n[ 13 ] I calculated excess mortality in Sweden for each year from 2000 on , by 5-year age group and sex , as the difference between actual mortality and normal mortality predicted by a regression fit to actual mortality rates over either 2000\u20132018 or 2009\u20132018 , and then used population data to derive the expected number of deaths in a normal year for 2019 and 2020 .\n[ 14 ] Mortality rates have been declining since 2000 in all age groups , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , the effect on overall mortality of declining mortality rates at each age is partially counteracted by the increasing average age of the population .\nWhen estimating normal mortality from trends in mortality over , alternatively , 2000\u20132018 or 2009\u20132018 , the excess combined 2019 and 2020 deaths were respectively 4,500 or 2,100 , representing 0.043 % or 0.020 % of the mid-2020 Swedish population .\nFor 2020 on its own , calculated excess deaths are 6,900 or 5,600 for the two regression bases ( 0.066 % or 0.054 % of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 2019 and 2020 combined were largely of men aged 65\u201379 and ( to a lesser extent ) aged 80\u201389 and 90+ .\nExcess deaths of women were under 30 % of those of men , based on mortality predicted by regressing over 2000-2018 , and were actually negative based on regressing mortality over 2009-2018 .\nOn both regression bases and for both sexes , 2019 plus 2020 deaths of under 65 year olds were lower than predicted .\nAnd average overall mortality for 2019 and 2020 combined was lower than for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably ever ) .\nA more detailed analysis of Swedish mortality in 2020 , but which used incomplete deaths data , was published a month ago by the blogger swdevperestroika ; it is well worth reading .\n[ 15 ] That article made similar points , and reached similar conclusions , to my own analysis .\nI applied a similar analysis method to derive excess deaths in England for 2019 and 2020 .\nThe data published in England are rather less satisfactory than in Sweden , so the derived estimates should be regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Table 1 of the UK Office of National Statistics ( ONS ) monthly mortality analysis for December 2020 , which spans 2001 to 2020 .\n[ 16 ] Doing so gives best estimates for combined 2019 and 2020 excess deaths of 113,000 ( 0.20 % of the population ) when predicting normal deaths by regressing age-standardised annual mortality rates over 2001\u20132018 , or 44,000 ( 0.08 % of the population ) when regressing over 2009\u20132018 .\nThe

"content": "The story from some media sources is that frozen wind turbines are responsible for the power shortfalls in Texas .\nOther media sources emphasize that fossil fuel resources should shoulder the blame because they have large cold induced outages as well and also some natural gas plants could not obtain fuel .\nExtreme cold should be expected to cause significant outages of both renewable and fossil fuel based resources .\nWhy would anyone expect that sufficient amounts of natural gas would be available and deliverable to supply much needed generation ?\nConsidering the extreme cold , nothing particularly surprising is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe technologies and their performance were well within the expected bounds of what could have been foreseen for such weather conditions .\nWhile some degradation should be expected , what is happening in Texas is a departure from what they should be experiencing .\nWho or what then is responsible for the shocking consequences produced by Texas \u2019 s run in with this recent bout of extreme cold ?\nTraditionally , responsibility for ensuring adequate capacity during extreme conditions has fallen upon individual utility providers .\nA couple decades ago I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning and generation planning efforts of an electric cooperative in the southeastern US .\nMy group \u2019 s projections , studies and analysis supported our plans to meet customer demand under forecasted peak load conditions .\nWe had seen considerable growth in residential and commercial heat pumps .\nAt colder temperature these units stop producing heat efficiently and switch to resistance heating which causes a spike in demand .\nOur forecasts showed that we would need to plan for extra capacity to meet this potential demand under extreme conditions in upcoming winters .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ this forecast was strongly challenged .\nProviding extra generation capacity , ensuring committed ( firm ) deliveries of gas during the winter , upgrading transmission facilities are all expensive endeavors .\nPremiums are paid to ensure gas delivery and backup power and there is no refund if it \u2019 s not used .\nSuch actions increased the annual budget and impact rates significantly for something that is not likely to occur most years , even if the extreme weather projections are appropriate .\nYou certainly don \u2019 t want to over-estimate peak demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting that demand .\nBut back then we were obligated to provide for such \u201c expected \u201d loads .\nOur CEO , accountants and rate makers would ideally have liked a lower extreme demand projection as that would in most cases kept our cost down .\nIt was challenging to hold firm and stand by the studies and force the extra costs on our Members .\nFortuitously for us , we were hit with extreme winter conditions just when the plan went in place .\nDemand soared and the planned capacity we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hit with the same conditions .\nLike us they had significant growth in heat pumps \u2013 but they had not forecasted their extreme weather peak to climb as we had .\nThey had to go to the overburdened markets to find energy and make some curtailments .\nThe cost of replacement power turned out to be significantly greater proportionately than we incurred by planning for the high demand .\nThey suffered real consequences due to the shortcomings of their planning efforts .\nHowever , if extreme winter had not occurred , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower than ours that year and that may have continued many years into the future as long as we didn \u2019 t see extreme winter conditions .\nInstead of the praise we eventually received , there would have at least been some annoyance directed at my groups for contributing to \u201c un-needed expenditures \u201d .\nThat \u2019 s the way of the world .\nYou can often do things a little cheaper , save some money and most of the time you can get away with it .\nBut sometimes/eventually you cut it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extreme .\nWho is responsible for providing adequate capacity in Texas during extreme conditions ?\nThe short answer is no one .\nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas ( ERCOT ) looks at potential forecasted peak conditions and expected available generation and if there is sufficient margin they assume everything will be all right .\nBut unlike utilities under traditional models , they don \u2019 t ensure that the resources can deliver power under adverse conditions , they don \u2019 t require that generators have secured firm fuel supplies , and they don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ready and available to operate .\nThey count on enough resources being there because they assume that is in their owner \u2019 s best interests .\nUnlike all other US energy markets , Texas does not even have a capacity market .\nBy design they rely solely upon the energy market .\nThis means that entities profit only from the actual energy they sell into the system .\nThey do not see any profit from having stand by capacity ready to help out in emergencies .\nThe energy only market works well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhile generally markets are often great things , providing needed energy during extreme conditions evidently is not their forte .\nUnlike the traditional approach where specific entities have responsibilities to meet peak levels , in Texas the responsibility is diffuse and unassigned .\nThere is no significant long term motivation for entities to ensure extra capacity just in case it may be needed during extreme conditions .\nEntities that might make that gamble theoretically can profit when markets skyrocket , but such approaches require tremendous patience and the ability to weather many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article from GreenTech media praises energy only markets as do many green interests .\nCapacity markets are characterized as wasteful .\nAndrew Barlow , Head of the PUC in Texas is quoted as follows , \u201c Legislators have shown strong support for the energy-only market that has fueled the diversification of the state \u2019 s electricity generation fleet and yielded significant benefits for customers while making Texas the national leader in installed wind generation .\n\u201d Why has Capacity been devalued ?\nTraditional fossil fuel generation has ( as does most hydro and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means such resources generally can be operated with a high degree of reliability and dependability .\nWith incentives they can be operated so that they will likely be there when needed .\nWind and solar are intermittent resources , working only under good conditions for wind and sun , and as such do not have capacity value unless they are paired with costly battery systems .\nIf you want to achieve a higher level of penetration from renewables , dollars will have to be funneled away from traditional resources towards renewables .\nFor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a system where the consumers \u2019 dollars applied to renewable generators are maximized .\nRewarding resources for offering capacity advantages effectively penalizes renewables .\nAs noted by the head of the PUC in Texas , an energy only market can fuel diversification towards intermittent resources .\nIt does this because it rewards only energy that is fed into the grid , not backup power .\n( Side note-it \u2019 s typical to provide \u201c renewable \u201d resources preference for feeding into the grid as well .\nSometimes wind is compensated for feeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess generation when fossil fuel resources are penalized .\nBut that \u2019 s another article . )\nTraditional planning studies might recognize that wind needs to be backed up by fossil fuel ( more so under extreme conditions ) such that if you have these backup generators its much cheaper to use and fuel them , than to add wind farms with the accompanying significant investment for concrete , rare earth metals , vast swaths of land \u2026 .\n.\nTraditional planning approaches often have to go to get around this \u201c bias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intermittent resources .\nWhen capacity value is rewarded , this makes the economics of renewables much less competitive .\nTexas has stacked the deck to make wind and solar more competitive than they could be in a system that better recognizes the value of dependable resources which can supply capacity benefits .\nAn energy only market helps accomplish the goal of making wind and solar more competitive .\nExcept capacity value is a real value .\nIgnoring that , as Texas did , comes with real perils .\nIn Texas now we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spikes that can result from devaluing capacity .\nThe impacts are increased by both having more intermittent resources which do not provide capacity and also because owners and potential owners of resources which could provide capacity are not incentivized to have those units ready for backup with firm energy supplies .\nWind and solar have value and can be added to power systems effectively in many instances .\nBut seeking to attain excessive levels of wind and solar quickly becomes counterproductive .\nIt is difficult to impossible to justify the significant amounts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy makers today using principals of good cost allocation .\nVarious rate schemes and market proposals have been developed to help wind and solar become more competitive .\nBut they come with costs , often hidden .\nAs I \u2019 ve written before , it may be because transmission providers have to assume the costs and build a more expensive system to accommodate them .\nIt may be that rates and markets unfairly punish other alternatives to give wind and solar an advantage .\nIt may be that they expose the system to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be that they eat away at established reliability levels and weaken system performance during adverse conditions .\nIn a fair system with good price signals today \u2019 s wind and solar can not achieve high penetration levels in a fair competition .\nHaving a strong technical knowledge of the power system along with some expertise in finance , rates and costs can help one see the folly of a variety of policies adopted to support many of today \u2019 s wind and solar projects .\nVery few policy makers possess anything close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaluation .\nFurthermore , while policy makers could listen to experts , their voices are drowned out by those with vested interests in wind and solar technology who garner considerable support from those ideologically inclined to support renewables regardless of impacts .\nA simpler approach to understanding the ineffectiveness of unbridled advocacy for wind and solar is to look at those areas which have heavily invested in these intermittent resources and achieved higher penetration levels of such resources .\nTypically electric users see significant overall increases in the cost of energy delivered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniformly decrease along with employment of renewables , but may instead increase due to how back up resources are operated .\nAdditionally reliability problems tend to emerge in these systems .\nTexas , a leader in wind , once again is added to the experience gained in California , Germany and the UK showing that reliability concerns and outages increase along with greater employment of intermittent resources .\nAnyone can look at Texas and observe that fossil fuel resources could have performed better in the cold .\nIf those who owned the plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been better off .\nMore emergency peaking units would be a great thing to have on hand .\nWhy would generators be inclined to do such a thing ?\nConsider , what would be happening if the owners of gas generation had built sufficient generation to get through this emergency with some excess power ?\nInstead of collecting $ 9,000 per MWH from existing functioning units , they would be receiving less than $ 100 per MWH for the output of those plants and their new plants .\nWhy would anyone make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal years and serve to slash your revenue by orders of magnitudes in extreme conditions ?\nThe incentive for gas generation to do the right thing was taken away by Texas \u2019 s deliberate energy only market strategy .\nThe purpose of which was to aid the profitability of intermittent wind and solar resources and increase their penetration levels .\nI don \u2019 t believe anyone has ever advanced the notion that fossil fuel plants might operate based on altruism .\nIncentives and responsibility need to be paired .\nDoing a post-mortem on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is inappropriate and incomplete .", "author": "curryja", "url": "https://judithcurry.com/2021/02/18/assigning-blame-for-the-blackouts-in-texas/",

information we have concerning the changes in Arctic climate in the recent and distant past .\nThe development of a European civilization occurred only because of the massive flow of sun-warmed water from the North Atlantic Current into the eastern Arctic Ocean , and it has survived despite the strong and natural variability of this flow .\nThe consequences for the people of the northern lands of Europe and North America during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norwegian Sea have not been \u2013 and will not be \u2013 comfortable : recall the call to arms of the scientific community in response to the advancing glaciers in mid-20th century because , after a 20-year progressive cooling in high northern latitudes and significant glacier advances , fears of a new glacial period were widespread .\nAn article in Science News suggested that \u2018 The unusually beneficial climate of the past few decades may be degenerating , facing humanity with a new challenge to survival \u2019 recalling the bitter winters at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ icy coastal waters of New York immobilised the British fleet , and the revolutionary army hunkered down in frozen fields in New Jersey .\n[ 2 ] Then , in the early 1980s , glaciers began to retreat again and northern air temperature data suggested that a new warming trend had set in , so we quickly forgot about ice ages and instead stirred ourselves into action to study the potential radiative consequences of CO accumulation .\nIndeed so profound is the loss of memory that a fundamental assumption today is that northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nExtraordinary surface air temperature ( SAT ) anomalies are reported over the Arctic Ocean of as much as 2.5-3.5oC , compared with a global mean anomaly of only 0.44oC for the same period .\nBut this result was based on inappropriate homogenised and gridded SAT data from all available land stations , together with surface air temperature data where these exist over the oceans .\nThe Arctic climate has been characterized by a millennial-scale cooling trend ( of order minus 0.22oC/1000 yr ) that correlates with a long period of weakening insolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Period and which was reinforced by feedback in higher latitudes .\n[ 3 ] The Danes who settled in eastern Greenland , built decent stone houses and churches , but vanished in the 13th century when they could no longer raise crops , were victims of the changing climate which only the indigenous population was able to survive .\nThis long period of weak solar radiation was reversed only in the final decades of the 19th century , with a renewal of warming that continues today despite the brief intermission of the 1940-60s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed that current reduced ice cover on the Arctic Ocean is a unique event , and perhaps some readers will think that those ships captains reports of \u201c unheard-of temperatures \u201d need not be taken seriously \u2013 but Norwegian oceanographers had also reported ice-free water to above 81oN , and that \u2018 warm Gulf Stream \u2019 water was encountered in their profiles as far north as Spitzbergen : they suggested that this should ensure ice-free conditions there \u2018 for some time to come \u2019 .\nThey also noted that \u201c \u2026at many points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea they have entirely disappeared \u201c .\nMean summer sea surface temperature at Spitzbergen had been around 3oC for 50 years prior to 1917 , but by 1922 had risen to 5oC , leaving open water around the island all winter .\nThis regional climate shift stimulated economic changes in the northern Barents Sea \u2013 the open season for shipping coal from Spitzbergen was to lengthen from 3 to 7 months by the late 1930s .\n[ 5 ] Thereafter , cooling again intervened in the Arctic and by the 1950s , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iceland , creating havoc with agriculture .\nAt Franz Josef Land the mean surface air temperature declined during the 1960s by 3-4oC and the winter minima declined by as much as 6-10oC .\nThe essential Icelandic hay crops once again failed and grain crops were abandoned , while fishing off both Iceland and west Greenland faltered as cod stocks declined or migrated .\nThis cold period in the Nordic and Arctic seas was only reversed during the late 1970s \u2013 but this time we heard no satisfaction that the region was becoming again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed that the warming was irreversible , because anthropogenic .\n[ 6 ] This concern would seem to ignore the clear evidence of warm conditions in the Arctic in the more distant past , especially in the regions to the northeast of Greenland where whaling effort was concentrated in the 19th century .\nWilliam Scorsby , the whaler , made regular voyages to this region and in 1811 noted that the ice barrier northeast of Greenland was breaking up : \u2018 I observed on my last voyage about two thousand square leagues ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 74-80o perfectly void of ice , all of which had disappeared in the last two years \u2019 .\nIn 1846 , on the Siberian coast , the River Lena was hard to locate in a vast flooded landscape and could be followed only by the \u2018 rushing of the stream \u2019 which \u2018 rolled trees , moss and large masses of peat \u2019 against a Russian survey ship , which secured from the flood \u2018 an elephant \u2019 s head \u2019 .\n[ 7 ] It is now abundantly clear that any model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrate the periods of warming and cooling known to have occurred in the past ; it must be compatible with observations of ice cover with the 60-80 year cyclical low atmospheric pressure and warming of the northern North Atlantic ( coded as the NAO ) and the concurrent increased flow of warm Atlantic water into the Arctic Ocean associated with an atmospheric Low Frequency Oscillation ( LFO ) .\nThis integration has not often been done in recent years , attention having shifted to the possible consequences of the radiative effects of atmospheric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ice cover in the 1990s was associated with a very active pattern of wind forcing \u201c due to the synchronous actions of the AO and the LFO \u201c .\n[ 8 ] At millennial time scales , the progress of warm and cool periods in the Arctic can be traced with the use of proxy data .\nLong ice-cores from two locations on Svalbard , whose chronology can be constrained by radionuclide and oxygen isotope analysis and by sulphate and volcanic dust layers of known date , are remarkable , recording even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 ] These and other multi-proxy evidence suggest that although there was a steady increase in ice-cover during the Holocene from a very low to a rather high summer coverage that peaked between 2000 and 4000 years ago , there were periods when there was sufficient open water in summer in the Canadian archipelago for Pacific and Atlantic bowhead whales to mingle , and for the Dorset and Inuit people to migrate eastwards along northern Canada .\n[ 10 ] A very long and continuous proxy record from Lomonosovfonna , Svalbard ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been used to demonstrate the progression of a winter cooling trend of about 0.3-0.9oC/century during more than a millennium prior to 1850 , at which time there was a brief warming followed by stasis .\n[ 11 ] The study of these cores has been extended using two shorter ( 1700-1980 ) ice-cores from Longyearbyen and Vardo on Svalbard whose chronology was constrained by radionuclide and oxygen isotope analysis and by sulphate and volcanic dust layers of known date , instrumental data from Vardo being used for calibration .\nThe changing distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during this long period of cooling has been confirmed by other proxies which give generally consistent results : reference horizons and annual-layers of oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopes in the Severnaya Zemlya ice core reveal that the cooling which reached absolute minimum temperatures in the 19th century was associated with a decline in summer insolation , and with concurrent growth of the ice cap from which the core was obtained .\n[ 12 ] Further evidence is not lacking for this result : analysis of the Lomonosovfonna ice core and of timberline tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reconstruct the evolution of ice cover in the western Nordic seas over this very long period .\n[ 13 ] This \u201c successfully explained 59 % of the variance in sea ice extent during the calibration period 1864-1997 \u201d and identified less persistent periods of low sea ice in the late 13th , the early 15th , and the mid-17th centuries .\nThe record is dominated by decadal-scale change associated with the NAO/Arctic Oscillations but the authors insisted that \u201c the present low sea ice extent is unique \u201d in the record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the late 19th century after the Little Ice Age of the 17th-19th centuries .\nThese cores suggest that surface temperature responds to some factor that marches in step with secular change in solar intensity : it would be easy to suggest that the connection is one of simple solar warming , but that case is not made here .\nThis long-term cooling appears to have been arctic-wide and independent of any direct consequences of solar radiation ( expressed as sunspots or solar flare frequency ) which took a generally opposite trend during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short periods ( i.e .\nrectangle in the sunspot figure ) there was a very good match between sunspot numbers and the temperature indicated by the proxies , even though direct and sustained correlation between sun and local surface temperature is not generally to be expected : rather , the sun \u2019 s activity cycles usually impose an indirect effect on atmospheric pressure cells and wind regimes resulting in local warming and cooling .\nObservations of correlation between solar activity and US surface temperature showed this very clearly : west of the continental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east of the mountains , the correlation was positive and increased towards New England where it was maximal .\n[ 14 ] This is not a unique case and similar regional relationships lie behind correlations between solar strength and the values of indices such as the North Atlantic Oscillation ( NAO ) .\nRather than a simple , CO -induced warming trend , records of ice-cover in the four seas that lie north of Siberia ( Kara , Laptev , East Siberian and Chukchi ) follow better the pattern of solar radiation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a low-frequency oscillation of frequency 60-80 years that \u2013 in the authors words \u2013 \u2018 places a strong limitation on our ability to resolve long-term trends \u2019 .\n[ 15 ] In any event , a stubborn positive state of the NAO characterized the final decades of the 20th century , associated with a strong pressure difference between the high and low pressure cells reduced ice coverage in the eastern Arctic significantly [ 16 ] .\nThe 8.5 Sv of warm ( 6-8oC ) , salty , Atlantic water flowing annually through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Circumpolar Boundary Current and is the main source of the regional surface water mass .\nAs it goes , it is progressively modified by heat flux to the atmosphere , river run-off and melt-water in summer , and by salt-rejection during freezing .\nAtlantic water carries almost 100 TW heat into the eastern Arctic Ocean annually , while another 10-20 TW passes into the Arctic basin through the Bering Strait in a flow of about 0.8 Sv of Pacific Ocean water .\n[ 17 ] Since 2002 , this process has accelerated due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the \u2018 memory of the system to the positive winter AO state that characterised the mid-1980s and 1990s \u2019 as Stroeve et al .\nput it .\n[ 18 ] As well , these authors note that the character of sea ice has also progressively changed after so long a period of positive NAO values , particularly in the progressive loss of multi-year ice .\nThe single , strongly-negative NAO index during the winter of 2009/2010 was not sufficient to reverse the process .\nThe pulses of warm Pacific water that pass north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the occurrence of a major incursion was confirmed in the late 1990s by observations of Pacific diatoms ( Neodenticulata seminae ) in Labrador Current water .\nThis water was transported in the anticyclonic gyral circulation along the Asian continental slope through the Makarov Basin to reach the Canadian Basin as a warm anomaly of about 0.5oC .\n[ 19 ] Variability in summer ice-cover in the Chukchi Sea , north of Alaska , has been correlated with the values of the AO and the NAO , and hence with the frequency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nDuring the years 1979-2009 there was an increasing frequency and strength of extreme wind events on the north coast of Alaska during late summer and autumn : mean extreme winds evolved from 7.0 to 10.5 m.sec-1 during this period .\nSome very strong wind events have been recorded in recent years \u2013 the August 2000 cyclone that wrecked the little town of Barrow on the north coast of Alaska included gusts that were reported at about 120 km.hr-1 .\n[ 20 ] Such conditions will not only hasten melting of ice formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that process , will also increase the apparent area of open water by rafting and compacting small , isolated ice floes .\nUnfortunately , no contemporary discussion of recent Arctic conditions can ignore the furore occasioned in September 2012 as the press reacted to the news that the area of open sea in the western Arctic Ocean was larger than the previous ice minimum observed a few years earlier .\nPerhaps this modern record for open water may have been the immediate effect of the passage of an exceedingly deep ( 970 mb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western Arctic in early August whose heavy winds fractured and dislodged the ice-pack .\nSuch consequences of variable wind stress in the central Arctic Ocean have been almost entirely ignored in discussions of ice loss , on the grounds that the evolution of ice cover is controlled almost entirely by air temperature and solar radiation .\nSatellite imagery show that a quasi-permanent depression may migrate around the central ocean in response to boundary conditions along the Asiatic and American coasts .\n[ 21 ] This depression and its associated cloudiness was prominent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that ice cover in mid-August of that year was relatively extensive compared with the year of minimal cover , 2012 .\nNOAA publishes an annual \u2018 Arctic Report Card \u2019 \u2013 described as \u201c a timely and peer-reviewed source for clear , reliable and concise environmental information on the current state of different components of the Arctic environmental system relative to historical records \u201d \u2013 that has been astonishingly successful in convincing readers that the Arctic has warmed at almost twice the rate of the rest of the planet and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in full swing \u201d .\nBut the Arctic Report Card takes a very generous view of the region , using 60oN as its southern limit .\nThis parallel passes just north of Scotland and includes all of Scandinavia and the entire northern half of Siberia down to the high country of eastern Asia .\nSome large cities ( Bergen , Oslo , Helsinki , St Petersburg and the rest ) are therefore included in the instrumental data from this region .\nThis is an extraordinarily extensive view , extending a full 5o latitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but NOAA are not alone in their choice : a similar pattern of Arctic temperature evolution is suggested by a Russian compilation of SAT data from almost 1500 northern hemisphere stations gridded in cells of 50 latitude x 100 longitude ( left , below ) .\nThis study has been cited in an influential review as \u2018 some of the first evidence of the warming over the Arctic Ocean projected by models \u2019 .\n[ 22 ] This conclusion is supported by a more sophisticated study ( above , right ) of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anomaly data from 441 land stations from the Russian archives and reaches the same conclusion , while suggesting that warmer summer temperatures have dominated the change .\n[ 23 ] However , the most pertinent \u2013 but largely neglected \u2013 description of how SAT has evolved over the Arctic Ocean is the compilation of Polyakov ( of U. Alaska ) because only very long coastal stations , mostly extending back to the 1880s , were used .\n[ 24 ] The selected data represent this region very adequately ( although I would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Finland and Sweden , and of Aberdeen in Scotland ) ; a simple pattern of SAT evolution within the arctic basin is indicated which conforms to this compilation does not support the same pattern of progressive warming as the two studies discussed above .\nOn the contrary , it makes perfectly clear that , on the coasts of the Arctic Ocean , the end of the century was no warmer than during the 1940s ; Polyakov attributes the pattern of change to the consequences of the northern hemispheric low-frequency oscillation ( LFO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another compilation of arctic data and proxies took 64oN as the limit of the Arctic region , within which 59 stations were used to analyze the pattern of regional co-variability for SAT anomalies based on PCA techniques .\n[ 25 ] The most important result of this study was obtained by power-spectrum analysis of the proxies that demonstrated quasi-periodicity of 50-80 years in ice cover in the Svalbard region : at least eight previous periods of relatively low ice cover can be identified back to about 1200 .\nThis low-frequency oscillation is ubiquitous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the ocean .\nCollectively , these studies present two critical results .\nThe first is that , around the shores of the Arctic Ocean and Nordic seas , surface temperatures did not reach levels equal to those of the 1930-40s even by the end of the 20th century : if any northern amplification of surface temperature exists , it stops short of the coasts of the Arctic Ocean .\nThe second , and perhaps more important , observation can not be avoided : that the pattern of temperature change obtained from surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very closely conforms to long-term persistent solar forcing .\nUnfortunately , when cyclical or periodic phenomena such as evident in Arctic temperatures are discussed , a solar cycle influence on surface air temperature is promptly proposed and as promptly rejected .\n[ 26 ] Most of the concerns expressed concerning Arctic amplification relate to the potential effect of the loss of ice cover on the Arctic Ocean and over the northern Barents Sea so perhaps it would have been better to look first at the evolution of temperature on the ice-fields themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from urbanized northern parts of Europe and Asia .\nThe data most appropriate for that task are those obtained at the drifting Russian ice-camp on the central Arctic Ocean : these record no progressive change in surface air temperature , annual means range in the rang of -17 to -20oC throughout the observing period , now unfortunately terminated .\n[ 27 ] This relatively unchanging pattern of the freezing/melting seasons on the central Arctic Ocean has nevertheless been accompanied by a progressive decrease in summer ice cover on marginal Arctic seas in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east of Greenland and along the Siberian coast and ( ii ) north of Alaska and Canada .\n[ 28 ] This has been associated with a long-term decrease in sea ice and bergs that are carried in the Labrador current to the adjacent North Atlantic , far to south of Newfoundland .\n[ 29 ] In the 1960s , this flux routinely extended as far south as the coast of Nova Scotia at 45oN , was reinforced by regional freezing on the Bay of Fundy as far south as the shores of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980s , these regions have been ice-free year-round .\nWhile research papers concerning Arctic amplification continue to appear , many do not examine the regional instrumental data directly and critically , but rather base their studies on ERA reanalyses of meteorological data : a recent case is that of the use of regional data from the GMST archive to specify surface temperature in relation to the rate of retreat of ice cover ; CMIP and other simulations \u201c are accurate only in runs that have far too much global warming..this implies that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice retreat for the wrong reasons ... \u201d .\n[ 30 ] Then , a second and perhaps more important observation can not be avoided : that the pattern of temperature change obtained from surface observations in the \u2018 real Arctic \u2019 very closely conforms to long-term persistent solar forcing .\nThis is , of course , a direct contradiction of the results of simulation models ( e.g .\nwith the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 3 of IPCC4 ) that have been used to affirm that that increased summer ice melt observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air temperatures over the ocean : \u201c the current reduction in Arctic ice started in late 19th century consistent with the rapidly warming climate and became very pronounced over the last three decades , unmatched\u2026last few thousand years and unexplainable by any of the known natural variabilities.\n\u201d [ 31 ] Despite such results , the above plot shows that surface temperature responds to some factor that marches in step with the progressive advance of secular change in solar intensity : it would be easy to suggest that the connection is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not made here .\nThe author of this plot pointed out that one prime consequence of solar forcing \u2013 at least in the northern hemisphere \u2013 is to control the Equator-to-Pole surface temperature gradient .\nThe Arctic Ocean has a unique role in modulating global climate state because of its open connection with the Atlantic Ocean , and perhaps also because of the consequences of downwelling in the Norwegian and the southern Labrador Seas .\n[ 32 ] These conclusions are inconsistent with standard assumptions concerning ice loss outlined in the \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assessments , which consistently attribute ice loss to increasing air temperatures .\nBut although everyone knows that sea water freezes only at lower temperatures than fresh water , the rather variable salinity of the surface layer of the Arctic Ocean is virtually absent from the IPCC discussion of causal mechanisms .\nSeasonal cycles of vertically-integrated heat storage and of energy transport suggest that the net surface flux across the ocean \u2019 s surface is the primary driver of seasonal heat change in the Arctic Ocean.. Balance is assumed in July between incoming SW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 230-240 Wm-2 ) , and also lateral atmospheric transport of 91 Wm2 .\nAbout 120 Wm-2 of SW radiation enters the ocean , which loses 10 Wm-2 of LW radiation back to the atmosphere .\n[ 33 ] A net July flux of 110 Wm-2 is therefore proposed from the atmosphere into the ocean , with which is associated some ice-melt and sensible heat gain , and this is presented as the principal cause of seasonal changes in heat storage in the Arctic Ocean , dominating the 6 Wm2 accumulated from heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensible heat flux associated with Atlantic and Pacific water passing into the Arctic .\nBut that model ignores the consequences of incursions of warm North Atlantic water through the Norwegian Sea , well past the Arctic Circle and approaching 80oN and so on into the Barents Sea : it suggests instead that atmospheric processes dominate the heat budget .\nCalculations such as those of the AR4 of the IPCC fail to answer the question before us : why is the Arctic so variable ?\nSince the model invokes oceanic and atmospheric data only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to represent the alternation of episodes of weak and strong Atlantic water influx to the Barents Sea were available to the model .\nIn the end , it is surely misleading to approach the variability of Arctic sea ice by considering only local conditions in the Arctic Basin .\nArctic variability can be understood only by emphasising that the Arctic region is wide open to the highly dynamic and variable North Atlantic current system .\n[ 34 ] Yet this oceanic connection merits only brief comment in AR5 : \u2018 Ocean circulation delivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in wind pattern associated with the NAO\u2026.probable drivers of increasing melt at some ice margins \u2019 .\nThis is a weak acknowledgement of the fact that the dynamics of Arctic Ocean sea ice \u2013 and so of the variability of the area and thickness of seasonal ice cover \u2013 is dominated by oscillations that are \u2018 associated with decadal components of the NAO/AO and multi-decadal lower frequency oscillations operating at 50-100 year .\nSea ice and NAO showed a non-stationary relationship during the observational period \u2019 .\n[ 35 ] Models agree that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the NAO and favours lighter ice conditions in the Eurasian Basin , as occurred during the period 1940-60 and again at the end of the century .\n[ 36 ] In fact , observations confirm that variability in the Arctic is very largely associated with the variability in the flows through open passages to both Atlantic and Pacific Oceans , which themselves respond to the different and characteristic variability of their circulation patterns , however forced .\nOf the two passages , the wide-open Arctic Ocean-Nordic Seas connection is the most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long been a focus of research and review , so that the dominant processes are now rather well understood and quantified .\n[ 37 ] Of the 8.5 Sv of warm , salty Atlantic water that passes north across the Greenland-Scotland Ridge annually , about 4.0 \u00b12.5 Sv passes into the Barents Sea either directly to the north of Norway as a barotropic flow , or along the western coast of Spitzbergen as a baroclinic flow .\nThis warm water ( 6-8oC ) carries almost 100 TW of Atlantic heat into the eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TW passes into the Arctic basin through the Bering Strait in a flow of about 0.8 \u00b10.2 Sv of Pacific Ocean water .\n[ 38 ] Because the incoming and the outgoing flows , warm and cold respectively , lie side-by-side between Greenland and Scandinavia , an asymmetry is induced in the distribution of ice-cover on the Arctic Ocean ; this is generally dense to the west of Fram Strait while , to the east of Spitzbergen , much of the Barents Sea \u2013 at similar latitudes \u2013 remains ice-free even in winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Fram Strait and down the eastern coast of Greenland also carries with it large volumes of fresh water as fragmented pack ice , a flow that is strongly episodic at decadal scale and is associated with the series of salinity anomalies observed in the Nordic seas that were discussed earlier .\nVariability in Atlantic flow into the Arctic basin is recorded in annual varves in sediment cores from the West Spitzbergen Channel , and these suggest that \u2018 the early-21st century temperatures of Atlantic water entering the Arctic Ocean are unprecedented over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linked to the Arctic amplification of global warming \u2019 .\nThis proposal was very influential in moulding opinion concerning the effects of anthropogenic global warming in the Arctic , and was based on the fact that the number of sub-polar species of fossil foraminifera currently being deposited exceeds the number of polar species for the first time in the last two millennia , and that by about double .\n[ 39 ] The significance of such events continues to be explored : a synthesis of circulation in the Arctic basin has been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the central Arctic Ocean since the 1890s , which were not previously accessible .\n[ 40 ] This makes it clear to what extent the variability in the inflow of \u2018 warm and salty \u2018 North Atlantic water at times of positive values of the NAO by importing \u2018 vast quantities of heat \u2018 into the Arctic Ocean to induce core temperatures in the intermediate layer in Nansen Basin that are much warmer than in the Canadian Basin , far downstream .\nCanada Basin and along the Siberian coastline , where it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water on this scale appears to be related to the pattern of low and high pressure cells in the atmosphere .\nA stubborn positive state of the NAO characterised the final decades of the 20th century , and was associated with significantly reduced ice coverage in the eastern Arctic due to incursions of Atlantic water .\nThe first evidence that a warm pulse in 1990 had entered the Arctic Ocean was the occurrence of anomalies of order 1oC in the deep water mass of the Nansen Basin .\nThis water was transported in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continental slope through the Makarov Basin to reach the Canadian Basin 7 or 8 years later as a warm anomaly of about 0.5oC .\nA second set of slightly warmer pulses was detected at Fram Strait in 2004 followed the same trajectory as in 1990 , and peak warming in the Eurasian Basin occurred in about 2007 .\n[ 41 ] The Canadian Larsen-93 survey of the eastern Arctic explored this intrusion of warm Atlantic water whose potential temperature maximum ( of 1-2oC ) had by then reached far into the Laptev Sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent polar ice cover : this was qualified as \u2018 a major thermohaline disturbance\u2026now occurring in the Arctic \u2019 by Eddie Cormack and his co-authors .\n[ 42 ] Because a < 50m layer of low salinity Arctic water lies directly below the ice , these deeper pulses of warm North Atlantic water are not in direct contact with the pack ice itself .\nBut , despite microstructure observations that suggest that mixing is very weak across this halocline , heat budget estimates nevertheless yield significant vertical fluxes .\nThese in turn suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 cm may be at least partially attributable to this flux , rather than to the supposed consequence of a warming atmosphere over the Arctic Ocean by the studies of Arctic SAT data that were discussed above .\nThe pulses of warm Pacific water that pass north through the Bering Straits are also rather variable , and the occurrence of a major incursion was confirmed by observations of Pacific diatoms ( Neodenticulata seminae ) in Labrador Current water in the late 1990s ; following the gyral circulation of the Arctic Ocean , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eastwards through the Chukchi Sea and along the Canadian coasts .\n[ 43 ] Sea surface temperatures at the source of these fluxes in the Bering Sea have followed the now-familiar pattern of a fin de si\u00e8cle repetition of the mid-20th century warming , and so they closely match the evolution of the PDO , seen here alongside change in the AMO .\n[ 44 ] The significance of this observation is that it confirms that the inflow of Pacific summer water ( PSW ) in the late 1990s through wind forcing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusually strong \u2013 as it must have been to transport Pacific organisms unusually far eastwards along the Canadian coastline and then south into the Labrador Sea .\nThe area of flow through the southern Canadian basin and the Chukchi Sea corresponds with the area of summer ice reduction during the late 1990s .\nHowever , increasing Bering Sea temperatures at the end of the 20th century can not formally be correlated with relative ice loss in the Arctic Ocean , and an alternative mechanism has been proposed : that the warm pulse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensures a more efficient transfer of momentum from wind to the coastal water mass which \u2018 in turn causes an imbalance between ice growth and ice melt \u2019 .\nThis feedback mechanism , leading to an abrupt change in coupling efficiency , is unique to ice-covered seas and may possibly dominate processes in the Arctic Ocean .\n[ 45 ] Variability in summer ice-cover in the Chukchi Sea , north of Alaska , has been correlated with the values of the AO and the NAO , and hence with the frequency of cyclonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years 1979-2009 there was an increasing frequency and strength of extreme wind events on the north coast of Alaska during late summer and autumn : mean extreme winds evolved from 7.0 to 10.5 m.sec-1 during this period .\nSome very strong wind events have been recorded in recent years \u2013 the August 2000 cyclone that wrecked the little town of Barrow on the north coast of Alaska included gusts that were reported at about 120 km.hr-1 .\n[ 46 ] Such conditions will not only hasten melting of ice formed the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will also increase the apparent area of open water by rafting and compacting small , isolated ice floes .\nConsequences of variable wind stress in the central Arctic Ocean have been almost entirely ignored in discussions of ice loss , on the grounds that the evolution of ice cover is controlled almost entirely by air temperature and solar radiation .\nYet informally-reported observations of satellite imagery show that , in at least some years , a quasi-permanent depression lies in the polar region , migrating around the central ocean in response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coasts .\n[ 47 ] This depression and its associated cloudiness was prominent in summer 2016 and was responsible perhaps for the fact that ice cover in mid-August of that year was more extensive compared the same date in the year of minimal cover , 2012 .\nTo summarise the arguments presented so far concerning ice-loss in the Arctic basin , at least five mechanisms must be now recognised in the absence of satisfactory evidence of anomalous warming of the surface air mass above the ice : ( i ) slowing of winter-ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from anomalously warm Atlantic water through the surface low-salinity layer below the ice , ( iii ) wind patterns that cause the export of anomalous amounts of drift ice through the Fram Straits and disperse pack-ice in the western basin , ( iv ) cloud cover associated with persistent depressions in the central ocean and ( iv ) the anomalous flux of warm Bering Sea water into the eastern Arctic of the mid-1990s .\nThese and other observations have been integrated into an oscillatory model with feedbacks and two unstable end-points that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate states , and also with recent analysis of ice dynamics in the Arctic basin by Zhakarov , whose model identifies feedback between atmosphere and ocean , both positive and negative , that interact in such a manner as to prevent long-term trends in either ice-loss or ice-gain on the Arctic Ocean to proceed to an ultimate state .\n[ 48 ] The model is conceptually simple : during periods of high precipitation when winter ice forms readily , summer ice cover increases , the atmosphere cools , the Arctic front together with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that freshwater input to the Arctic Ocean decreases , and winter ice cover is thicker , has a deeper draft , and so survives better in summer .\nThis , in turn , shifts the Arctic front poleward again , warms the atmosphere and so completes the cycle by reinforcing the influence of the halocline of the Arctic Ocean .\nThis oscillatory mechanism for the control of Arctic summer ice cover , based on the changing freshwater balance of the upper layer of the Arctic Ocean , has been interpreted more recently in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 propagates through a network of synchronised climate indices \u2019 with the familiar 60-80 year Gleissburg frequency .\nBased entirely on observations , it has been demonstrated that the AMO signal propagates sequentially \u2013 with suitable delays \u2013 through a suite of other indices of northern climate states , culminating in an opposite-signed hemispheric signal associated with the AMO after about 30 years .\nThis sequence has been presented in the following abbreviated form : This matches very closely the sequence observed : a warming regime was initiated around 1918 following a transition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn the early 1920s this was followed by the same transition in the AT and then , in about 1930 in the PDO and finally , at the end of the 1930s , a switch to a cooling regime in the Arctic that introduced a new northern hemisphere state to a warming regime that was once again initiated by a new transition in the AMO .\nThe tempo of this sequence modulates stock-size in some important species of cold-water commercial fish , and hence the ecological state of northern seas .\n[ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cyclical and appears to lie behind the alternation of bistable , alternating climate states observed in proxies during inter-stadial periods between Quaternary glaciations .\nThis model is surely correct in its general assessment of the critical importance of the state of the North Atlantic and of the significance of the Barents Sea connection between subtropical and polar regions , even though it has been attacked vigorously .\n[ 51 ] This critical region controls climate states at scales that interest us today , supporting the argument made in the last chapter and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arctic regions as a simple and direct response to anthropogenic contamination of the atmosphere , as required the standard model ?\nBut ignoring all this , some agency reports continue to refer to the progressive loss of seasonal ice cover in the Arctic Ocean exclusively as a consequence of anthropogenic warming of the atmosphere .\nThe NASA Goddard report on winter sea ice extent in 2016 was typical : it was \u2018 another record low \u2019 attributable to record high atmospheric temperatures \u2018 around the globe and in the Arctic \u2019 and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention is made of earlier alternation of cold , heavy-ice and warm , open-water periods .\n[ 52 ] This is in line with NOAA \u2019 s annual \u2018 Arctic Report Card \u2019 \u2013 described as \u201c a timely and peer-reviewed source for clear , reliable and concise environmental information on the current state of different components of the Arctic environmental system relative to historical records \u201d \u2013 that has been astonishingly successful in convincing readers that \u201c The sustained transformation to a warmer , less frozen and biologically-changed Arctic remains clear \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a report on the progress of a very sick patient in hospital : the progress of seven \u2018 Vital signs \u2018 are tabulated , comparing progress or regress from year to year .\n[ 53 ] The attitudes of NASA and NOAA are contagious .\nA press report on climate research on Svalbard and in Norway described interviews with scientists then working at Longyearbyen , who talked of the recent period of sea-ice loss and glacier retreat as if it were a unique and novel event \u2013 no mention was made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Ingebrigsteen almost a century previously .\n[ 54 ] Such a myopic view of environmental change is unfortunately very common today for reasons only too easily understood .\nThe continent and oceans at the bottom of the world The Antarctic is the antithesis of the Arctic , the southern polar region being occupied by a high , continental-sized mass of ice that reaches to 5000m elevation , having depths over terrain of 2-4 kms ; this ice flows coastward , especially down the valleys in the fragment of Gondwana that lies below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of western Antarctica is a sector of the volcanic \u2018 ring-of-fire \u2019 that surrounds the Pacific Ocean , so geothermal activity occurs along this coast and the Peninsula that stems from it .\n[ 55 ] The opening of the Drake Passage during the Cenozoic isolated Antarctica and created continuity of the Southern Ocean around the bottom of the planet , radically altering ocean circulation in the southern hemisphere .\n[ 56 ] Consequently , the South Atlantic basin is not an inverted mirror-image of the North Atlantic and its form ensures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not pass down the coast of South America to very high latitudes as Gulf Stream water flows up the coast of North America and on into the Arctic basin .\nInstead , the warm water of the Brazil Current turns eastward at 60oS within the South Atlantic gyre towards Cape Town and does not penetrate the frigid surface water mass of the Southern Ocean .\nFurther , some of the warm surface water that is formed in the South Atlantic is lost to that ocean when it flows into the North Atlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this flow carries 23 Sv above 1000m \u201c of which 16 Sv are warmer than 7oC and form the source waters of the Florida Current \u201d later to enter the Gulf Stream .\n[ 57 ] This is perfectly clear in Tomczac and Godfrey \u2019 s classic figure ( below ) which also shows that the poleward transport of warm tropical water in the Indian Ocean is curtailed when the Agulhas Current runs out of topography at < 40oS before reaching the Cape and turns eastward across the Indian Ocean .\nJust a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the South Atlantic , eventually dissipating at around 300S off Argentina .\nSo , although sun-warmed water penetrates so far polewards in the North Atlantic that its variability controls the extent of ice cover on the Arctic Ocean , the Antarctic continent is insulated by the eastward-flowing Southern Ocean from the direct influence of water from tropical seas : nevertheless , even in winter , ice does not cover the entire ocean south of the subpolar front .\nThis paradox has caught the attention of several research groups , which are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the observations require a thermodynamic mechanism based on surface heating , while others offer a simpler explanation based on regional wind-drift of pack ice .\n[ 58 ] Three ice-shelves extend out to sea from the Antarctic continent and are many times thicker than seasonal pack-ice , standing 25-50m above sea level .\nAt their termination they fracture and release large tabular bergs that infest the Southern Ocean and were noted by the earliest navigators : their evolution is not an anthropogenic anomaly .\nThere has been much recent concern over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying to the east of the Peninsula ) is showing signs of break-up at its termination .\nThis ice-shelf attracted the attention of Revelle , who computed a global 70 cm rise in sea level when it disintegrates and melts .\nGeothermal heat below some of the glaciers that flow onto the shelf causes intermittent changes in their flow rates , so these ice shelves can not be entirely stable .\nA longer view of ice-shelf history ( from a British Antarctic Survey group ) concluded that regional \u201c warming for several centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peninsula poised for collapse \u201d although the effect is \u201c comparatively modest \u201d over West Antarctica and no significant change has been recorded for the rest of East Antarctica .\nRegional climate conditions over the Southern Ocean are dominated by the consequences of change in the westerly winds that sweep around the continent .\nSustained velocities of > 14m/sec-1 are typical , so \u201c to reach Antarctica one must cross at least 600 miles of the roughest seas in the world\u2026no land to interfere with the west to east circulation of air\u2026this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Antarctic continent perpetually \u201d .\n[ 59 ] These winds are induced between the northern side of the polar low pressure vortex and the southern side of the subtropical high pressure cells of the Indian , South Pacific and South Atlantic Oceans .\nConsequently , westerly wind strength around Antarctica is related to changes in the state of these cells , especially of the South Pacific high pressure cell that lies \u2018 upwind \u2019 of the Antarctic peninsula .\n[ 60 ] Changes in the pressure gradient along the southern border of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wind speed around the polar vortex : these changes are coded as Southern Annular Mode ( SAM ) anomalies and are associated with large changes in the southern hemisphere climates of Patagonia , Australia and New Zealand and with some influence from ENSO states in low Pacific latitudes .\n[ 61 ] Wind strength has increased around the polar vortex since the 1970s and consequently the SAM anomaly has taken increasingly values \u2013 and higher temperatures have been recorded on the Antarctic peninsula .\n[ 62 ] This observed progression of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the progressive destruction of stratospheric ozone by some 60-odd variants of molecules of the halocarbon refrigerants , solvents , propellants , and foam-blowing agents that we now find convenient to use .\nOzone molecules are ephemeral and the presence of CFCs tips the balance towards their reduction which occurs preferentially within the two polar vortices .\nIn transient experiments , the evolution of polar stratospheric CFCs is predicted to take the following course in response to CFC-control measures in place or envisioned .\n[ 63 ] Fortunately , we can monitor this evolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique in the confidence that may be placed on surface temperature data : we have direct access to 17 selected monthly mean data sets in the SCAR READER archive , maintained and edited by British Antarctic Survey \u2013 and therefore by some of those who made the observations \u2013 for research purposes : no homogenisation of the archive , and no gridding has been done .\n[ 64 ] But it will be useful first to consider how we have had to proceed without this initiative of the SCAR .\nOur primary resource @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data from NASA , using data in the grid boxes below .\nBox 71 includes parts of the Peninsula and also of Tierra del Fuego , so contains data from inhabited places , including small airports having strong terminal warming trends .\nThe GISTEMP gridding procedure requires that stations on the Antarctic peninsula that are within 1200 kms of these places should be homogenised with them .\nSmall wonder then , that Orcades Base on the South Orkney islands in Box 71 ( left , below ) has warmed quite strongly following the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 72 , on the South Hebrides , Grytviken has perhaps been homogenised with regional SST , as the rules require in the case of isolated islands ( right , below ) .\nTo add to the confusion in the classical data , note that the UK CRUTEM data for Grytviken have also been homogenised with neighbouring boxes \u2013 but in this case so as to give a sustained warming since around 1940 .\nIt is not clear how GISTEMP homogenisation was performed on the twenty or so Antarctic stations in the four grid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been done , because the GISTEMP data of each differs strongly from the original observations archived in the GHCN by NOAA .\nThe only possible solution ( more or less within the rules ) would have been to treat these as islands and homogenise them with adjacent SST .\nBut , however it was done , this homogenisation is at least partly responsible for the RRR ( Recent Regional Rapid ) warming described by a team from Goddard and the British Antarctic Survey : \u201c During the last century the temperatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase of around 2.8oC makes this the most rapidly warming region of the Southern Hemisphere\u2026during the past 25 years 25,000 km2 ice has been lost\u2026etc .\netc \u201d .\n[ 65 ] This appears to me to be an overstatement and the present discussion is based on unhomogenised data which are available from two sources , ( i ) the GHCN-all archive of NOAA and ( ii ) the READER archive of the Scientific Committee for Antarctic Research ( SCAR ) .\nAlso consulted are data from

.\nEach is plotted below together with the values of the Southern Annular Mode and , as you would expect , it is the Peninsula stations that most closely follow the wind regime in the Southern Ocean : here , the consequences of the evolution of the stratospheric ozone hole are plain for all to see .\nSeven stations warmed < 0.1oC/yr over a 70 -year period and the greatest warming \u2013 at Faraday/Vernadsky \u2013 reached < 0.5 oC/yr or close to the IPCC estimate of global warming during the 20th century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar degree of warming was its neighbour , the Rothera station which , in the GHCN-all records , is a transcription of an untidy version of the Faraday/Vernadsky data .\nHowever , warming of the peninsula stations ceased around the turn of the century and they began gently to cool , the only exception being Orcados on the South Orkney Islands ; this change of trend has been attributed to strengthened westerly winds on the Weddell Sea and in the mid-latitude jet .\n[ 66 ] Conditions here are very strongly influenced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction in the level of stratospheric CFCs discussed above .\nThis may have occurred either as a result of control measures or perhaps naturally by change in the location , pattern and strength of the polar vortex .\n[ 67 ] Temperatures recorded at Scott Base on the shores of the Ross Sea warmed progressively after the year 2000 , following the trend of the two inland , higher altitude stations .\nBut this trend perhaps requires investigation : a different pattern that lacks any progressive warming , is demonstrated by local , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 15 sites in the hills above Scott Base have exhibited no warming since measurements were undertaken in 1985 ; the data bundle from these instruments is shown below .\n[ 68 ] They record temperatures on the very edge of viability for microbial soil biota .\nIn the same region , the surface air temperature on the Ross Ice Shelf has been monitored for 35 years with an array of 13 Automatic Weather Stations .\nThese data describe the climate that characterizes the central and coastal regions of the shelf and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any sustained trend in surface temperatures .\n[ 69 ] Nor do the GHCN data for McMurdo , situated on the coast adjoining the Ross Ice shelf , support the warming pattern post-1970 at Scott Base shown by SCAR data , but rather of a shift in conditions near 1970 .\nI can offer no comment except to note that Scott Base is currently under reconstruction .\nIt will be useful to review some other examples of GHCN data for Antarctica .\nBelow ( left ) are GHCN data from Belgrano appropriate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the data indicates the move of the observatory to more solid ground .\nDespite this move , the record testifies to 70 years of regional thermal stasis .\nSimilarly , long-term change in GHCN surface temperature at Mawson and Concordia on the east coast , facing Australia , is no more than a very slight cooling trend over a similarly long period .\nRussian observations at Vostok , an inland station on the slopes of western Antarctica , suggest that progressive warming has not been observed there since 1950 .\nRather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mean annual air temperature has cooled progressively recently : the monthly plot ( right , below ) suggests that , for a period of 20 years , observations at Vostok were problematic , but were taken in hand around 2005 : how to connect the early and recent periods is not obvious Be that as it may , SCAR READER data show both Vostok and the Amundsen-Scott polar station warming in the final years : at the Pole , this trend ( which coincided with the opening of the new station building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmospheric circulation pattern at mid-southern latitudes , resulting from a downward shift in the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation and therefore with increased transport of warm air from the Weddell Sea over the continent .\n[ 70 ] The most urgent reports of warming come from the Peninsula , where research on the status of ground cover of lichens and moss suggests some regrowth ; however , this volcanic area has surface evidence of geothermal heat , which may not to be hoped-for explanation of observations .\nSuch questions are currently examined by data from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established in the 1940 \u2019 s , later transferred to the Ukraine and reopened as Vernadsky : it is reported to be one of the fastest-warming stations on Earth with a long-term change of 0.54oC/decade over the year and twice that during winter .\n[ 71 ] Unfortunately , the reporting and control of the observations at Faraday prior to its transfer left something to be desired : ( i ) the station was moved in 1954 from the small offshore Winter Island to Galindez , closer to the coast .\nHere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after 1979 as ice cover progressively decreased on the Bellingshausen Sea , ( ii ) the data submitted to WMO contained several short data gaps in early years , and data for 10 years prior to the transfer to Ukraine failed to enter either the GHCN or GISTEMP , but now appear in the READER archive as plotted below , ( iii ) , variability in the observations significantly tightened under Ukrainian management .\nIndeed , the data from the final 20 years appear not to be a continuation of previous observations \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transfer of ownership ?\nYet , despite these uncertainties the GHCN archive at Vernadsky was cited in 2005 as \u201c an extreme case , about twice \u201d that of the overall , long-term warming trend on the Peninsula : 0.6oC annually and 1.1oC in winter semesters .\nThis has been associated with appropriate changes in pressure systems and the concurrent trend in the value of the Southern Annular Mode .\n[ 72 ] However , I would prefer not to place much confidence in the data from Vernadsky and this opinion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these data appears in the GHCN under the name of nearby Rothera Point .\nThere will be those who complain that the GHCN data used here to support the main arguments of this piece are unhomogenised , are not those used by the IPCC , and therefore that my arguments are unsupported .\nAnd , indeed , I would be much more comfortable if we had a set of very reliable , very long-term data from a limited number of locations rationally distributed across all land surfaces and for which one could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented progressive temperature change : the SCAR READER archive is a superb prototype for what we require .\nThe USA is a special case , being the largest region for which we have many long , well-managed records , numerically heavily weighted towards rural observations .\nThe data speak for themselves : there has been no progressive warming in the USA during the last 150 years and the evolution of SAT follows very generally that of the Sun .\nThis demonstration is perfectly clear but almost perfectly ignored even though the patterns that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from rural places do not support the standard model of a warming .\nplanet The Antarctic data in the READER archive have the same message for us as the US rural-dominated data \u2013 the equilibrium climate sensitivity of CO must be at the lower end of the discussed values : this is clear from the observations of thermal stasis except where and when the consequences of Southern Annular Mode anomalies and of stratospheric ozone depletion are significant .\nIt is not surprising , then , that there has been some quiet grumbling that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special purposes , and was not being performed rationally , but this grumbling has been ignored by the IPCC .\nIn his masterly \u2018 Critical Review of Surface Temperature Data Products \u2018 , Ross McKittrick addressed this issue head-on by comparing all pairs of raw and adjusted GISTEMP data in grid-cells in which both are present ; he found that until about 1980 , the adjustments resulted in a temperature cooler than the observations , but in later years corrections tended to be in the opposite sense .\nThe consequence is that \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in global records derived from the adjusted GHCN archive results from the adjustments and not from the underlying data \u2019 .\nThe unavoidable consequence is that \u2018 a portion of the warming trend shown in global records derived from the adjusted GHCN archive results from the adjustments and not from the underlying data \u2019 .\nThese adjustments increase the 20th century warming by 0.3-0.40C and this warming is now widely assumed to be real .\n[ 73 ] Others have , of course , investigated this , at least informally , and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June 2016 the Goddard Station Selector facility was modified so that the individual GHCNv3 data were shown in four states : colour-coded as submitted , as adjusted , as cleaned and as homogenised .\n[ 74 ] For a time , this enabled click-by-click verification of McKittrick \u2019 s results ( a different colour line for each of 4 steps in the homogenisation ) , and this abundantly confirmed his results \u2013 but now you can click as hard as you like , but only the final homogenised plot is shown .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So climate change research proceeds profitably using a debased currency managed by two US governments agencies .\nBut there \u2019 ll be a bill to be paid for that one day in shuttered university departments and government agencies\u2026..

.\nThe latest issue of The Breakthrough Journal is a tour de force .\nExcerpts from the Introduction to the issue : Donald Rumsfeld famously opined on the problems of decision-making in the face of \u201c known knowns , \u201d \u201c known unknowns \u201d and \u201c unknown unknowns.\n\u201d To those three categories Rayner added a fourth , \u201c unknown knowns \u201d \u2014 the things we actually know but pretend we don \u2019 t .\nHe called this \u201c uncomfortable knowledge , \u201d referring to all that policy makers and institutions forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree , banishing uncomfortable knowledge from the picture was unavoidable , Rayner argued .\nFaced with a world of irreducible complexity , humans must construct simplified versions of reality in order to act .\nBut when institutions are unable to integrate uncomfortable knowledge into policy making , the consequences can be grave .\nThis is true not just with regard to short-term policy outcomes , but also to the long-term credibility of the institutions .\nA year later , the Covid-19 pandemic has offered us an object lesson in how this is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts , pundits , and provocateurs made bold pronouncement after overconfident prediction .\nPolicy makers announced restrictions , based ostensibly on the best available science and then abandoned them within days .\nAs often as not , the facts are subservient to our interpretations of their meaning .\nSuccess at containing the virus in Vietnam , Taiwan , Korea , and Japan doesn \u2019 t count because they are Asian countries .\nNew Zealand does because they are like \u201c us.\n\u201d High case rates in the United States and the UK are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders .\nIn Italy , Spain , and France , they are due to aging populations and higher density .\nOne thing , though , seems certain .\nWith each twist of the plot , each new skirmish among dueling experts , each round of blame-saying when things don \u2019 t work out as promised , our social and political institutions lose a little more credibility .\nAs with the pandemic , so with the world .\nThis issue of the Breakthrough Journal is titled , Uncomfortable Knowledge , in homage to Rayner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inspired so much that we have published over the years .\nIt includes Rayner \u2019 s final essay , \u201c , \u201d published posthumously with Daniel Sarewitz .\nIn the essay , Rayner and Sarewitz offer a valedictory of Rayner \u2019 s thinking about the demands and perversities of \u201c post-normal \u201d science , how normative views about nature inform science as it relates to risk , technology , and the environment , and the ways in which so much of what we call science today does not actually describe nature but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are increasingly removed from anything we can observe or test .\nThe resulting hash of normative claims , confirmation biases , superficial empiricism , unfalsifiable predictions , counterfactuals , and counter-counterfactuals has , unsurprisingly , been attended by declining faith in the sciences , experts , and institutions that presume to guide us on these matters .\nIn response , many observers conclude that we have entered a \u201c post-truth \u201d era , in which right-wing populists , conspiracists , and alternative healers are waging a war on science with potentially devastating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut Rayner and Sarewitz argue that this isn \u2019 t so .\nThe problem is not that charlatans have duped the public with pseudoscience and misinformation but rather that the expert class and the institutions in which they are embedded has failed to attend to the panoply of public values that are unavoidably implicated in the construction of policy-relevant science .\nThe solution , they argue , is not more research , better science communication , or louder condemnations of science denial .\nInstead , it is greater cognitive pluralism \u2014 both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shape solutions \u2014 so that both are better able to speak to a broader range of normative postures toward risk .\nMuch of the discussion of the \u201c war on science \u201d and our \u201c post-truth \u201d condition , of course , regards not a generalized condition but a specific controversy , the failure of policy makers to heed the recommendations of climate scientists , with many climate advocates claiming that the failure to act is the result of a sustained campaign of media disinformation underwritten by fossil fuel interests .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dominik Stecula argue that there is little evidence to support this claim .\nDrawing upon a comprehensive study of three decades of news coverage of the issue , Merkley and Stecula find that mainstream media outlets , including conservative outlets like the Wall Street Journal and Fox News , have never given climate skeptics much of a platform .\nThat , however , is not the end of the story .\nThe media has played a role in the polarization of attitudes about the issue , just not the role that many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conventional environmental story about climate denial , \u201d Merkely and Stecula write , \u201c is that it ignores the critical and polarizing impact of cues Republican voters received from Democratic and liberal elites.\n\u201d Over the last two decades , Republicans have become more skeptical about climate change .\nThis is not because they were taking their cues from science denialists in the media but because they were reacting negatively to high-profile liberal and environmental climate advocates who have dominated media coverage .\nThat is indeed uncomfortable knowledge for those who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media coverage and have shaped the broader narrative .\nAnd so partisans and environmentalists invented a conspiracy to explain their failure to win over the public rather than countenance the possibility that two decades of framing the issue in ways that served partisan and ideological ends predictably polarized the issue along partisan and ideological lines .\nIn \u201c What Would Hayek Do About Climate Change , \u201d Sagoff takes aim at neoclassical economists who argue that the problem is the result of a \u201c market failure \u201d that can be solved by pricing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prices actually do .\n\u201c Markets are for discovery , not utility , \u201d Sagoff argues .\nPrices convey information , not value .\n\u201c If the American Economic Association ( AEA ) had its way , it would set prices in terms of its calculus of the social cost of carbon , \u201d Sagoff writes .\n\u201c Entrepreneurs would then plan not around market prices but around AEA \u2018 prices , \u2019 which float in the doctrinal and political winds .\nThis turns investment into speculation \u2014 bets on what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Hayek , Sagoff speculates , would have understood climate change not as a problem of market failure but as one of information , discovery , and innovation .\nHe would not have objected to government acting as investor and venture capitalist , or even paying more for nascent clean energy technologies .\nBut he would have objected to government attempting to fix markets by setting prices .\n\u201c By chanting a ritual \u2018 market failure \u2019 abracadabra over social problems , \u201d economists , Sagoff argues , \u201c would replace a free-market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieve a figment of their mathematical imagination , i.e.\n, welfare , being better off , or utility , which they expect to be paid to measure.\n\u201d Across a long and varied career , Rayner , an anthropologist by training , was less interested in what science does in the abstract , or what its intrinsic value is , than what it is for .\nHow do we use it ?\nWhy do we trust it ?\nHow do the sciences , and the people who interpret them for policy-makers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world , produce outcomes that we want , and make better decisions ?\nIn these regards , Rayner was as concerned with the misuse of science , and scientific authority as he was with all that science could do .\nWhether it is climate scientists who demand ever more media coverage of their science , environmental advocates who insist that their political agenda is simply the law of thermodynamics writ small in social policy , or economists who imagine that they can reliably estimate the costs of climate change at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbon tax levels today , all of the essays in this issue speak , in one way or another , to this question .\nThe notion that public science could reasonably characterize the costs and benefits of climate change over a century or the behavior of a nuclear waste repository over millennia , or even the global consequences of a quickly unfolding pandemic across hundreds of regions with different populations , cultures , and institutional traditions and capacities asks something of science , and the institutions in which it lives , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Nobody worries , \u201d Rayner and Sarewitz observe , \u201c whether laypeople trust astrophysicists who study the origins of stars or biologists who study anaerobic bacteria that cluster around deep sea vents.\n\u201d Nor have most of us come to distrust surgeons or airline pilots .\nIt is rather a particular kind of science , \u201c making claims upon how we live and how we are governed \u201d that so many of us no longer trust .\nThis sort of science has become so intensely contested in the early decades of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is to the complex interface of human societies , public health , the natural world , and technology , carries so much uncertainty across so many valences of human choices and values .\nLay publics are right to mistrust strong claims , whether they come from scientists , policy-makers , or advocates , based upon this sort of science .\nFor this reason , Rayner cared far more about civic institutions than the knowledge they embody ; believing that good institutions , capable of navigating competing interests and worldviews , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c good science.\n\u201d That perspective has proven ever more prescient and valuable as so much public science has become increasingly untethered from claims that are actually observable or testable in nature , as our expert class has become ever more unaccountable to its many competing and overconfident claims and predictions , and as our political class has become unwilling to take responsibility for their actions and decisions .\nThe problem is not so much the science relevant to social controversies regarding risk , technology , and the environment but the elites and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have watched so many of our institutions fail and so much of our political culture come apart , it only becomes clearer that our capacity for self-government in advanced developed economies depends upon reestablishing a healthy interface between science , public institutions , and the publics they serve .\nSadly , Steve Rayner is no longer here to help us navigate these challenges .\nBut his work and legacy have left us a deep reserve to draw upon as we grapple our way toward what Rayner recognized would always be \u201c clumsy solutions @ @", "author": "curryja", "url": "https://judithcurry.com/2021/03/03/uncomfortable-knowledge/", "published":

.\n[ 1 ] , on the relationships between cloud feedback , climate sensitivity ( ECS ) and aerosol-cloud interaction in the latest generation of global climate models ( CMIP6 ) has just been published .\nThe key conclusion of the paper is : The new open-access paper \u2013 the senior author of which , Gabriel Vecchi , is a well known professor of geosciences at Princeton University \u2013 provides further evidence that high ECS CMIP6 models do not realistically simulate the behaviour of the Earth \u2019 s real climate system .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in CMIP6 models ; it is 1.8\u20135.5 K as compared with 2.0\u20134.7 K in the previous , CMIP5 , generation .\nFar from the science being settled in relation to the response of the climate system to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations , insofar as it is represented by climate models uncertainties appear to be growing .\nThe main cause of the overall upwards shift in ECS in CMIP6 from CMIP5 \u2013 the mean ECS increased by about 0.5 K in addition to the 0.8 K increase in the highest ECS \u2013 is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern Ocean , in many models .\n[ 2 ] The stronger positive cloud feedback arises both from cloud cover and albedo decreasing more with surface temperature , driven by changes in the physical representation of clouds in many CMIP6 models .\n[ 3 ] However , a growing body of evidence indicates that the high ECS CMIP6 models are unrealistic .\nFor instance , paleoclimate proxy data are not compatible with the high ECS CMIP6 models .\n[ 4 ] The new paper provides further evidence , here from the historical period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper \u2019 s Abstract : It was noticed back in 2007 that , in then current models , the change over the 20th century in total forcing was strongly correlated with that in aerosol forcing , and that their ECS was reciprocally related to their total forcing change .\n[ 5 ] That is what one would expect if modellers were tuning their models to match the observed change in global mean surface temperature ( GMST ) .\nIn CMIP5 models , aerosol forcing was more evidently correlated with GMST rise [ 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well be because fewer modelling groups tuned their models to match the historical rise in GMST .\nAlso , despite it being a solid , very basic part of climate science , there was huge variation in forcing from CO and other greenhouse gases in CMIP5 models .\nTo help bring out the relationship between cloud feedback and the other variables in CMIP6 , Wang et al .\nseparate out from the 30 models they analysed the 9 models with the most positive cloud feedback ( range +0.78 to +1.18 Wm\u22122K\u22121 : T9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least positive cloud feedback ( range \u22120.20 to +0.30 Wm\u22122K\u22121 : B9 models ) .\n[ 7 ] In CMIP6 there is again a strong correlation between aerosol forcing , in particular that related to cloud changes , cloud feedback , and ECS , as Figure S4 of the new paper ( reproduced as Figure 1 below ) shows .\nFigure S4 is the same as Figure 1 of the paper except that it only includes one model from each of the 20 institutions , which makes it clearer .\nB9 models are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Figure 1 , while T9 models are at the right .\nDue to only one model per institution being included , only six of the B9 models and six of the T9 models are shown .\nPanel a of Figure 1 shows that ECS is strongly positively correlated with cloud feedback across CMIP6 models ( r2=0.74 , or 0.69 if all models from each institution are included ) .\nPanel b of Figure 1 shows a quite strong negatively correlation between cloud feedback and aerosol-mediated cloud radiative response \u0394R aer ( which includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on clouds and nonlocal changes in clouds that result from aerosol-induced changes in the large-scale circulation ) .\nThat is , the T9 models ( those with the most positive cloud feedback ) tend to have a more negative \u0394R aer than the B9 models .\nSomewhat surprisingly , the T9 models have a less negative clear-sky direct aerosol forcing than the B9 models , but the much larger differences between indirect cloud-related aerosol forcing in B9 and T9 models dominate .\nThe filled circles in Figure 1 represent the top 50 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their simulations with observed historical GMST warming ( 1990\u20132014 mean minus 1880\u20131909 mean ) ; the bottom 50 % are shown by open circles .\nThe correlations are stronger when only the 50 % of models most consistent with observed GMST warming : the r2 is 0.81 not 0.59 between cloud feedback and \u0394R aer , and 0.84 between ECS and cloud feedback .\nOf the ten models whose historical simulations most are consistent with observed GMST warming , four have positive \u0394R aer , and four have weakly negative \u0394R aer ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between ECS and \u0394R aer , which is fairly weak ( r2 =0.26 ) when consistency with historical warming is not tested , is strong ( r2 = 0.78 ) across the 50 % of models most consistent with observed GMST warming .\n[ 8 ] Figure 1 .\nCloud feedbacks , ECS , and aerosol-mediated cloud radiative responses ( \u0394R aer ) in CMIP6 models ; one model per institution .\nReproduced from Figure S4 of Wang et al .\nB9 models are shown by the leftmost circles in each panel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown by the rightmost circles , only six of each being included due to the restriction to one model per institution .\nThe paper points out that , since anthropogenic aerosol emissions are very largely in the northern hemisphere , models with stronger aerosol-mediated cloud radiative responses should show greater interhemispheric asymmetry in total cloud radiative response ( cloud forcing ) and hence in warming .\nFigure 2 , which reproduces Figure 4 in the paper , illustrates these points

ECS is 1.81\u20132.86 K , with a mean of 2.5 K , far lower than the mean of 3.7 K for all the models .\nThose institutions that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above 4.5 are increasingly looking as if they may

Mann , distinguished professor of atmospheric science and director , Earth System Science Center , Penn State .\n\u201c Two decades ago , we brought the AMO into the conversation , arguing that there was a long-term natural , internal climate oscillation centered in the North Atlantic based on the limited observations and simulations that were available then , and coining the term \u2018 AMO.\n\u2019 Many other scientists ran with the concept , but now we \u2019 ve come full circle .\nMy co-authors and I have shown that the AMO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change driven by human forcing in the modern era and natural forcing in pre-industrial times.\n\u201d The researchers previously showed that the apparent AMO cycle in the modern era was an artifact of industrialization-driven climate change , specifically the competition between warming over the past century from carbon pollution and an offsetting cooling factor , industrial sulphur pollution , that was strongest from the 1950s through the passage of the Clean Air Acts in the 1970s and 1980s .\nBut they then asked , why do we still see it in pre-industrial records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mar .\n5 ) in Science , is that the early signal was caused by large volcanic eruptions in past centuries that caused initial cooling and a slow recovery , with an average spacing of just over half a century .\nThe result resembles an

pocket from a report I \u2019 m writing , I \u2019 ve excerpted the relevant text below ( apologies for not having links to the references ) : The Atlantic Ocean is particularly important to the global ocean circulation due to the existence of North Atlantic Deep Water ( NADW ) formation in the northern North Atlantic , a vital component of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northward flow of warm salty water in the upper Atlantic and the southward flow of the transformed cold fresh NADW in the deep Atlantic , which is a major driver of the substantial northward Atlantic heat transport across the equator .\nBasin\u2010scale multidecadal fluctuations have been observed in the Atlantic sea surface temperature ( SST ) .\nThe large\u2010scale multidecadal variability observed in the Atlantic has been referred to as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation ( AMO ) .\nThe multidecadal character of the AMO is distinguished from interannual ocean variability forced by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North Atlantic , the North Atlantic Oscillation ( NAO ) .\nThe term Atlantic Multidecadal Variability ( AMV ) is often used , because the observed multidecadal fluctuations in the Atlantic may not be an oscillation at a single frequency but consist of a broader band of low\u2010frequency signals .\nThe Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation ( AMO ) is associated with basin-wide SST and sea level pressure ( SLP ) fluctuations .\nFor the positive AMO phase , this is sometimes presented as an almost uniform warming of the North Atlantic .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phase with a pattern of horseshoe-shaped SST anomalies in the North Atlantic with pronounced warming in the tropical and parts of the eastern subtropical North Atlantic , an anomalously cool area off the U.S. East Coast , and warm anomalies surrounding the southern tip of Greenland .\nThe past 100 to 150 years of Atlantic SSTs are characterized by a net century-long rise and periods of multidecadal warming and cooling .\nHowever , the rationale for the \u2018 Trend+AMO \u2019 separation is confounded by lack of linearity in the global warming trend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe nonlinearity is particularly pronounced during the period 1945-1975 , when global SSTs showed a slight cooling trend .\nTo address the ambiguities associated with detrending in formulating the AMO index , Johnstone ( 2017 ) has formulated an Atlantic \u2018 Arc \u2019 Index , based on the leading Principal Component of north Atlantic SST variability ( 60\u00b0N to 0\u00b0 , 70\u00b0W-0\u00b0W ) .\nThe Atlantic \u2018 Arc \u2019 SST index reflects coherent variability within a basin-scale arc-shaped pattern ( sometimes referred to as a \u2018 horseshoe \u2019 ) , a signature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Atlantic , the midlatitude eastern boundary and much of the subpolar north ( Fig .\n9.2 ) .\nFigure 9.2 .\nThe Arc pattern is delimited by the bold black line , which encompasses the tropical North Atlantic , the midlatitude eastern boundary and much of the subpolar north Atlantic .\nFrom Johnstone .\nThe Arc pattern is recognized as a spatial signature of the AMO , identified with coupled ocean-atmosphere variability , and is closely related to a \u2018 tripole \u2019 pattern of SST response to the NAO .\nThe Arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to multidecadal period recognized as a cool phase of the AMO ( Figure 9.3 ) .\nSince the Arc Index combines both the AMO variability and the overall warming trend , it is more usefully interpreted as defining multidecadal regimes and shifts ( see section 9.4 ) .\nThe Arc Index ( Figure 9.3 ) shows abrupt shifts to the warm phase in 1926 and 1995 , consistent with the conventional AMO analysis in Figure 9.1 .\nJohnstone \u2019 s analysis indicates a shift to the cold phase in 1971 , which differs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that indicates the shift to the cold phase in 1964 .\nThe AMO index of Klotzbach and Gray ( 2008 ) also indicates a shift to the cold phase in 1970 .\nFigure 9.3 .\nTime series of the Atlantic Arc Index from 1880 through early 2018 .\nFrom Johnstone .\nThe brevity of available instrumental data limits our understanding of the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability ( AMV ) .\nPaleoclimate proxy\u2010derived reconstructions of AMV\u2010related signals that extend beyond the instrumental era provide an important basis for understanding the nature and stationarity in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et al .\n( 2017 ) AMV reconstruction using terrestrial proxy records ( tree rings , ice cores , etc . )\nover the past 1,200 years has both broad spatial coverage and high temporal ( annual ) resolution .\nWang et al .\n( 2017 ) found that large volcanic eruptions and solar irradiance minima induce cool phases of Atlantic multidecadal variability and collectively explain about 30 % of the variance in the reconstruction on timescales greater than 30 years .\nThey isolated the internally-generated component of Atlantic multidecadal variability , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that the AMO is the largest contributor to Atlantic multidecadal variability over the past 1,200 years .\nZhang et al .\n( 2019 ) provides a summary of studies that have analyzed paleoclimate data to investigate whether AMV is internally or externally driven .\nOver the past 12 centuries , the reconstructed solar and volcanic forcing do correlate with the Wang et al .\n( 2017 ) AMV reconstruction , but their combined contribution explains less than one third ( 28 % ) of the total AMV variance ; the reconstructed AMV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal variability component of the Wang et al .\n( 2017 ) AMV reconstruction also reveals significant signals at multidecadal timescales above a red noise background and its amplitude during the preindustrial period , especially before the Little Ice Age , is on the same order as that found in the instrumental AMV index .\nPaleo proxies also supportthe existence of an AMOC\u2010AMV linkage over the past several centuries .\nKnudsen et al ( 2010 ) used paleoclimatic data to show that distinct ~55-70 year oscillations characterized the North Atlantic ocean-atmosphere variability over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nThe Holocene AMO signal appears to have been quasi-periodic and the associated climate response to have been of highly variable intensity , both in time and space .\nIn the tropical Atlantic , the AMO response signal was generally relatively weak during the Northern Hemisphere warming of the Holocene thermal maximum ( HTM ) between 5,500 and 9,000 BP , after which it picked up in intensity .\nThrough the past 8,000 years , minor shifts appear to have occurred in the dominating period within the 55- to 70-year band .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 5,500\u20138,000 BP was ~65 years , whereas it shortened somewhat between 5,500 BP ( before present ) and ~2,700 BP ( 55\u201360 years ) .\nThe period of the dominant oscillations increased slightly again after ~2,700 BP ( 65\u201370 years ) , but the oscillations were generally not as well defined as during the early Holocene , when the AMO period bandwidth appears to have been narrower .\nKnudsen et al ( 2010 ) provides the following additional insights .\nThe AMO response signal exhibits a general shift in its pattern within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signal was most pronounced in the Arctic during the HTM , whereas in the tropics its maximum was generally reached after the HTM .\nBetween 2,000 and 3,500 BP , there was a statistically significant recurrence of multidecadal oscillations in the Arctic .\nThis interval overlaps with a part of the neo-glaciation between 2,000 and 3,000 BP , which was characterized by relatively high SST and generally warmer , and particularly unstable , climate conditions in parts of the northern North Atlantic region .\nSuch conditions meant that the Arctic sites temporarily became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly due to an associated reduction in Arctic sea-ice cover .\nHowever , the major changes in North Atlantic circulation patterns that followed the neo-glaciation in both hemispheres led to a generally weakened AMO response signal after ~2,000 BP .\nThis change was accompanied by a distinct SST decline between 2,000 and 500 BP in some parts of the northern North Atlantic .\nDespite ongoing debates about the climate dynamics of the AMV , it is generally accepted that the AMV represents a complex conflation of natural internal variability of the Atlantic Meridional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red-noise stochastic forcing of the ocean by the atmosphere ( primarily the NAO ) , and external forcing from volcanic events , aerosol particles and greenhouse gases .\nThe Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation ( AMO ) is the most prominent mode of multi-decadal Atlantic variability ; however the AMO \u2019 s physical origins remain a topic of ongoing debates .\nObserved AMO SST changes have long been attributed to slow variations in northward upper-ocean heat transport by the AMOC .\nOcean processes offer a plausible mechanism for large multidecadal climate variations ; such inferences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the short record of AMOC circulation that begins only recently in 2004 .\nSeveral additional hypotheses for AMV mechanisms have been proposed .\nAnthropogenic aerosols have been hypothesized to be a prime driver of the observed AMV .\nThe argument is that an increase in the linearly detrended AMV SST index is forced by the increased downward shortwave radiative heat flux induced by the decreased anthropogenic aerosols through their interaction with clouds .\nHowever , the observed decline in the subpolar AMV SST signal over the most recent decade is inconsistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight decrease ) in anthropogenic aerosols over the North Atlantic region .\nAs summarized by Zhang et al .\n( 2019 ) , the hypothesis that changes in external radiative forcing is a prime driver of AMV disagrees with many observed key elements of AMV .\nUsing observations and models , Delworth et al .\n( 2017 ) examined the relationship between the North Atlantic Oscillation ( NAO ) and Atlantic decadal SST variations .\nConsistent with many previous studies , on short time scales NAO-related surface heat flux anomalies drive a tripole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOn decadal and longer time scales , there is a lagged response of the ocean to the NAO fluxes , with the AMOC playing a prime role in modulating meridional oceanic heat transport and generating an AMO-like SST response .\nA prolonged positive phase of the NAO enhances the AMOC after a decadal-scale delay .\nDelworth et al .\n( 2017 ) found that decadal-scale SST variability in the subpolar and tropical North Atlantic are well correlated .\nWhile ocean dynamics plays a crucial role for decadal-scale SST variability in the extratropical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study suggest that its direct influence in the tropical North Atlantic appears to be smaller , with local air\u2013sea fluxes playing a larger role .\nLin et al .\n( 2019 ) argues for two different sources for AMO variability , identifying 50\u201380 year and 10\u201330 year AMOs that are associated with different underlying dynamics .\nAssociated with a positive AMO at 50\u201380 year period is enhanced westerlies north of 60N but weakened between 40-60N , which is dynamically consistent with an enhanced polar vortex and linked to variability in the Pacific .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ year AMO is a zonally asymmetric pattern with blockings prevailing over high latitude North Atlantic and cyclonic anomaly over subtropical North Atlantic , which is independent from the variability over Pacific sector .\nWhile the 10\u201330 year AMO may be linked directly to the dynamics over the tropical Atlantic , the 50\u2013 80 year AMO is heavily related to the cross-basin interaction between the North Atlantic and the Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian Seas .\n( Note : consistent with the stadium wave . )\nWillis et al .\n( 2019 ) identified a tripolar SST anomaly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gyre , and the Norwegian seas that varies on 8\u201320 yr time scales .\nTheir results suggest that the AMO is confined to the subpolar North Atlantic , while the tropical Atlantic varies primarily on shorter ( intradecadal ) time scales .\nIn another study , Muller , Curry et al .\n( 2013 ) identified a strong narrow peak in the AMO with period of ~ 9 yrs .\nNigam et al .\n( 2018 ) showed that the decadal component of the AMO is closely related to the Gulf Stream variability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stream ( GS ) path coincides with the cold AMO phase with cold SST anomalies in the subpolar gyre .\nThe GS \u2019 s northward shift is preceded by the positive phase of the low-frequency NAO and followed by a positive AMO tendency by 1.25 and 2.5 years , respectively .\nThe temporal phasing is such that the GS \u2019 s northward shift is nearly concurrent with the AMO \u2019 s cold decadal phase ( cold , fresh subpolar gyre ) .\nKwon et al .\n( 2019 ) found that the evolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warm versus the cold phase of the AMV .\nFor the AMV warm phase , the warm SST anomalies in the western subpolar gyre are damped by the surface heat flux , and thus pose anomalous heating in the lower troposphere and reduce the overall meridional gradient of the atmospheric temperature .\nConsequently , the storm track activity weakens .\nAs the blocking substantially influences the seasonal mean atmospheric circulation , the negative phase of NAO dominates at the same time .\nRuprichRobert and Cassou ( 2014 ) found that the full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complex time-evolving relationship with both North Atlantic Oscillation ( NAO ) and East Atlantic Pattern ( EAP ) ( Figure 9.8 ) .\nThe AMOC rise leading to a warm phase of AMV is statistically preceded by wintertime NAO+ and EAP+ from lag -40/-20 yrs .\nAssociated wind stress anomalies induce an acceleration of the subpolar gyre ( SPG ) and enhanced northward transport of warm and saline sub- tropical water .\nConcurrent positive salinity anomalies occur in the Greenland\u2013Iceland\u2013Norwegian Seas in link to local sea-ice decline ; those are advected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea participating to the progressive densification of the SPG and the intensification of ocean deep convection leading to AMOC strengthening .\nFrom lag -10 yrs prior to an AMOC maximum , the opposite relationship is found with the NAO for both summer and winter seasons .\nNAO- acts as a positive feedback for the full development of the AMV through surface fluxes but , at the same time , prepares its termination through negative retroaction on AMOC .\nRelationship between EAP- and AMOC is also present in summer from lags -30/+10 yrs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AMV peak .\nAll together , the combined effect of NAO and EAP are responsible for an irregular and damped mode of variability of AMOC/AMV that takes about 35\u201340 years to build up and about 15\u201320 years to dissipate .\nIn addition to the direct NAO-/EAP- action , the termination of AMOC/AMV events is also induced by the advection of anomalous fresh water from the subtropical North Atlantic basin along the mean western boundary ocean circulation , and also from the Arctic due to considerable ice volume loss associated with overall atmospheric warmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9.8 Schematic diagram for an AMOC/AMV positive event .\nRuprichRobert and Cassou ( 2014 ) Update : An excellent new publication was pointed out to me on twitter that supports the general conclusions of my write-up https : //journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/32/22/jcli-d-19-0177.1.xml # .YEO-7oO1x98.twitter As summarized by Robson et al .\n( 2012 ) , in the mid-1990s the subpolar gyre of the North Atlantic underwent a remarkable rapid warming , with sea surface temperatures increasing by around 1.8oC in just 2 years .\nThis rapid warming followed a prolonged positive phase of the North Atlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coincided with an unusually negative NAO index in the winter of 1995/96 .\nBy comparing ocean analyses and carefully designed model experiments , they showed that this rapid warming can be understood as a delayed response to the prolonged positive phase of the NAO and not simply an instantaneous response to the negative NAO index of 1995/96 .\nFurthermore , they inferred that the warming was partly caused by a surge and subsequent decline in the meridional overturning circulation and northward heat transport of the Atlantic Ocean .\nRobson et al .\n( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large volume of the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean has cooled significantly , reversing the previous warming trend .\nBy analyzing observations and a state-of-the-art climate model , they showed that this cooling is consistent with a reduction in the strength of the ocean circulation and heat transport , linked to record low densities in the deep Labrador Sea .\nThe low density in the deep Labrador Sea is primarily due to deep ocean warming since 1995 , but a long-term freshening also played a role .\nThey inferred that the observed cooling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Atlantic Ocean since 2005 can not be explained as a direct response to changes in atmospheric circulation over the same period .\nJohnstone ( 2017 ) describes a \u2018 coupled shift model \u2019 of low-frequency North Atlantic climate change , based on abrupt transitions between quasi-stable sea surface temperatures and coupled atmospheric circulations .\nThis hypothesis describes recurrent step-like changes in North Atlantic SST , wherein high-amplitude SST perturbations are occasionally maintained as anomalous multidecadal climate states by positive atmosphere-ocean feedbacks .\nStatistical evidence is presented that low-frequency SST changes were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a series of short , discrete events , characterized by abrupt ~1 year step-like shifts that separate longer multidecadal periods of relatively little change .\nThe strong Atlantic warming of the mid-1990s ( Figure 9.1 ) , which is represented by filtered AMO indices as a gradual process lasting a decade or more , can be traced to an abrupt and remarkably continuous rise in basin-scale SST , beginning in October-November 1994 , and essentially accomplished as a +0.8\u00b0C SST change across most of the North Atlantic by July 1995 ( Figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1994-95 went undamped in successive months , during the next few years , and fully through the subsequent two decades up to the present , rapidly introducing a new warmer climate state .\nThe basin-scale expanse of the 1995 shift can be seen in the abrupt shift in monthly SST anomalies over both the subpolar North Atlantic ( 50-60oN ) and the subtropical margins of NW Africa , which warming together in nearly simultaneous fashion ( Arc Index , Figure 9.2 ) .\nShifts appear in the annual Arc SST record ( Fig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1925-26 ( +0.5\u00b0C ) , 1970-71 ( -0.3\u00b0 ) , and 1994-95 ( +0.6\u00b0 ) that were followed by multidecadal persistence of similar anomalies with respect to prior years ( 1926-1970 : +0.5\u00b0C , 1971-1994 : -0.2\u00b0C , and 1995-2014 : +0.5\u00b0 ) .\nEach of these intervals lacks a significant linear Arc SST trend , suggesting that large transient climate changes were followed by restabilization of the upper-ocean heat balance and persistence of new anomalous conditions over years to multiple decades .\nArc SST changes 1926 , 1971 and 1995 occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October-March ) Ni\u00f1o 3.4 SST , suggesting a systematic role for ENSO in the generation of low-frequency North Atlantic climate changes .\nA more specific regional indicator appears in the correspondence of Arc SST shifts with high-amplitude SST changes off northwest Africa , which peaked September 1925 , August 1970 and November 1994 .\nWest African SSTs are a prominent component of the Atlantic Multidecadal Mode ( AMM ) , which may serve as a bridge across time scales , sustaining SST perturbations as sustained climate anomalies .\nA physical implication of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur through occasional pulses of upper-ocean heat uptake and release , rather than gradual or cumulative processes .\nAtmosphere-ocean conditions leading to 1994-95 warming share notable similarities with the warming of 1925-26 and ( oppositely ) with the cooling of 1970-1971 , suggesting predictability of major North Atlantic climate shifts .\nAll three events were preceded during the prior 2-3 years by uniquely strong sea level pressure ( SLP ) anomalies of opposite sign around the Norwegian Sea within a broader NAO-like pattern .\nIn each case , the transitional winter featured moderate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change , and each shift was distinguished by extreme local SST changes off NW Africa .\nHistorically , Atlantic shifts have been marked by extreme short-term SST changes off NW Africa : behavior that is not currently evident , as subtropical and tropical areas of the Arc remain in a warm state begun in 1995 .\nHowever , it is notable that subpolar SSTs from 50-60N show evidence of abrupt cooling since 2015 ( Fig .\n9.10 ) , behavior suggestive of a \u2018 partial \u2019 shift that might soon involve the broader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The current divergence between subpolar and tropical North Atlantic SST is potentially analogous to behavior seen during the late 1960s-early-1970s , when rapid subpolar cooling in 1969-70 slightly preceded the sharp 1971 drop in tropical SST .\nBased on historical patterns , an abrupt shift to cooler conditions may be imminent , although the unusually long regime from 1926 to 1970 suggests that a substantial delay of up to 10-20 years may also be plausible .\nFigure 9.10 .\nAnnual SST anomalies for the subpolar and tropical North Atlantic .\nSubpolar SST ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop and persistently cool conditions since 2015 ( 20\u00b0N- 0\u00b0 , red ) .\nSimilar divergence around 1970 might provide an early indication of tropical and broader North Atlantic cooling within the next few years .\nTo what extent was the 1995 shift in the AMO predictable by climate models ?\nMsadek et al .\n( 2014 ) summarize the decadal prediction experiments conducted using the GFDL Climate Model .\nInitializing the model produces high skill in retrospectively predicting the mid-1990s warming , which is not captured by the uninitialized forecasts .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warming of the SPG ( subpolar gyre ) ; however , only the ensemble-mean hindcasts initialized in 1995 and 1996 are able to reproduce the observed abrupt warming and the associated decrease and contraction of the SPG .\nThe enhanced Atlantic decadal prediction skill is achieved primarily by initializing AMOC anomalies , instead of predicting AMOC anomalies at northern high latitudes .\nIn contemplating a possible future shift to the cold phase of the AMO , it is instructive to consider the prior shift to the cold phase that occurred in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s , when the sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic Ocean cooled rapidly .\nHodson et al .\n( 2014 ) demonstrated that the cooling proceeded in several distinct stages : \u2022 1964\u201368 : The initial cooling is largely confined to the Nordic Seas and the Gulf Stream Extension .\nThere are no notable atmospheric circulation anomalies during this period , aside from a small low MSLP anomaly over the Arctic in October\u2013June .\n\u2022 1968\u201372 : As the cooling progresses , cool anomalies extend to cover much of the subpolar gyre @ @ @ @

Europe and into Asia .\n\u2022 1972\u201376 : The cool anomalies reach their maximum magnitude and spatial extent during this period .\nThe western part of the subtropical North Atlantic does not show a significant cooling , resulting in a tripole ( or horseshoe ) pattern .\nThe pattern of SLP anomalies projects on the positive phase of the NAO .\nMany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is consistent in some respects with the available observations .\nHowever , the mechanisms differ strongly from model to model , and the inadequate observational database does not allow a distinction between \u2018 realistic \u2019 and \u2018 unrealistic \u2019 simulations ( Latif and Keenlyside , 2011 ) .\nRuiz-Barradas et al .\n( 2013 ) examined historical simulations of the AMO in CMIP3 and CMIP5 models .\nVariability of the AMO in the 10\u201320/70\u201380 year ranges is overestimated/ underestimated in the models .\nCheng et al .\n( 2013 ; 2015 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AMOC ) simulated by 10 models from CMIP5 for the historical and future climate .\nThe multimodel ensemble mean AMOC exhibits multidecadal variability with a 60-yr period ; all individual models project consistently onto this multidecadal mode .\nAs summarized by the NCA ( 2017 ) , the simulated AMOC-AMV linkage varies considerably among the coupled global climate models , likely resulting from the spread of mean state model biases in the North Atlantic .\nThe AMOC-AMV linkage depends on the amplitudes of low-frequency AMOC variability , which is much weaker in climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the underestimated

report with the help of a very capable assistant .\nThis project was just too irresistible to turn down .\nMy evaluation report can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final ] .\nThis blog post addresses scenarios of 21st century sea level rise outcomes , including a critique of the Rutgers scenarios .\nThe main points are excerpted in this blog post ; see the full report for background and details .\nAlso see this press release from the NJ Business and Industry Assoc [ link ] Global sea level rise projections provide a basis for projecting local sea level rise , such as for the New Jersey coast .\nThe analysis in this section places the projections provided by the Rutgers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe analysis provided below demonstrates that the Rutgers projections of sea level rise are substantially higher than those provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .\nIn 2019 , the IPCC published a \u201c Special Report on Oceans , Cryosphere and Climate Change \u201d ( SROCC ) , which included updated sea level rise projections ( Table 2.2 ) based on the same CMIP5 climate model simulations that were used in the IPCC AR5 .\nIt is instructive to compare the sea level rise projections in the second-order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the final report .\nThe SROCC values for RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 are comparable to the AR5 values .\nHowever , the SROCC sea level rise projections for RCP8.5 ( high emissions scenario ) are significantly higher than the AR5 values ( upper end of the likely range is 0.98 m ) .\nIt is notable that the RCP8.5 values in the final SROCC report are substantially lower than in the second order draft .\nThe volatility of the sea level rise projections for RCP8.5 ( high emissions scenario ) reflects deep uncertainties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instability of the West Antarctic ice sheet and its influence on future sea level rise .\nTable 2.2 : Projections of global mean sea level rise for 2100 from the IPCC SROCC ( baseline period 1986-2005 ) .\nThe sea level rise scenarios from the forthcoming IPCC AR6 are not yet available .\nHowever , a publicly available letter ( King et al .\n2020 ) cited the following values from the 2nd order draft of the AR6 : projections for 2100 range from 0.82 \u2013 0.98 meters ( 32.3 \u2013 38.6 inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 4.3 \u2013 4.8oC ( 7.8 \u2013 8.6 oF ) .\nWhile the AR6 temperature projections are higher than the AR5 , the CMIP6 sea level rise projections for the emissions/ concentration scenario equivalent to RCP8.5 are lower than the values in the SROCC .\nIt remains to be seen whether the sea level rise projections will change in the AR6 final report .\nWhile there is general convergence in the IPCC reports on the projected likely range for sea level rise for the low and intermediate emissions/concentration scenarios ( RCP2.6 , RCP4.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagreement regarding sea level rise for the high emissions scenario ( RCP8.5 ) .\nThis uncertainty is associated with the impact of potential instabilities in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet , which could be triggered by large values of warming .\nThe emissions scenarios used in the Rutgers Report do not directly relate to the emissions scenarios used in the IPCC AR5 and SROCC ( e.g .\nRCP2.6 , RCP4.5 , RCP8.5 ) .\nRather , the Rutgers Report selects two scenarios based on the amount of warming since early industrial ( 1850-1900 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 5oC ( high emissions ) .\nThe Rutgers high emissions scenario is close to RCP8.5 through 2100 .\nHowever , the Rutgers low emissions scenario reflects more warming than RCP2.6 .\nThe Rutgers team then averaged the sea level rise projections for their high and low emissions scenario to create a moderate emissions scenario , nominally associated with a temperature increase of 3.5oC .\nThe rationale for using these new definitions of high and low emissions scenarios is to accommodate the Bamber et al .\n( 2019 ) expert elicitation on sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West Antarctic ice sheet , which used the 2oC and 5oC scenarios .\nIt is somewhat surprising that the Rutgers Report elected to structure their scenarios following Bamber et al.\n, since the Report states that \u201c SEJ [ structured expert judgment ] , however , is not fully accepted by the ice-sheet modeling community , as it relies on the calibrated mental models of the participating experts rather than explicit physical models.\n\u201d Since the Rutgers Report didn \u2019 t use the same emissions scenarios as the IPCC , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea level rise projections that are cited in the Rutgers Report as providing the basis for their local sea level rise projections are : Kopp et al .\n( 2014 ) , Kopp et al .\n( 2017 ) , Rasmussen et al .\n( 2018 ) and Bamber et al .\n( 2019 ) .\nKopp et al .\n( 2014 ) yields projections of likely global mean sea level changes that are broadly consistent with IPCC SROCC .\nKopp et al .\n( 2017 ) replaced the original Antarctic ice-sheet mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2014 ) with those from the Antarctic ice-sheet modeling study of DeConto and Pollard ( 2016 ) .\nBamber et al .\n( 2019 ) replaced the Greenland and Antarctic ice-sheet projections of Kopp et al .\n( 2014 ) with projections based on an expert elicitation of ice-sheet changes associated with climate scenarios leading to 2\u00b0C and 5\u00b0C of warming by 2100 .\nTable 2.4 compares the likely range predicted by Kopp ( 2014 ) and Kopp ( 2017 ) with the IPCC projections .\nWhile the Kopp ( 2014 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Kopp ( 2017 ) projections are almost twice as high as the IPCC projections for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 .\nWhile not directly comparable to the other projections , the Bamber et al .\n( 2019 ) values are even higher .\nTable 2.4 : Comparative projections of global mean sea level rise ( meters ) for 2100 based on different emission scenarios .\nThe Rutgers scenarios of future climate change are formulated in a fundamentally different way than the IPCC .\nThe IPCC provides a range of temperature and sea level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emissions scenarios .\nThis results in a continuum of temperature and sea level rise projections whose likely range overlaps among the different emissions scenarios .\nBy contrast , the Rutgers Report provides distributions of sea level rise for two temperature scenarios : 2oC and 5oC .\nA third , intermediate scenario is provided by simply averaging the temperature and the sea level rise percentile .\nThe Rutgers approach does not discriminate in a meaningful way the range of temperature scenarios ( including the lower bound ) for which the potential instability of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sea level rise in the 21st century \u2013 the relevant processes are nonlinear with temperature and can not be interpolated based on temperature in a meaningful way .\n4.3 Evaluation of predictions from the Rutgers Report : 2000-2020 The projections provided in the Rutgers report for NJ sea level rise use as a baseline the period 1991-2009 ( nominally the year 2000 ) .\nHence , the observed tide gauge data through 2020 can be evaluated against the sea level rise projections in the Rutgers Report ( Table 4.1 ) .\nWith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are already more than 2/3 through this period .\nWhen based on the trends since 1980 , there is 3.51 inches ( 0.29 feet ) of sea level rise at Atlantic City during the period 2000-2020 .\nReaching 9.6 inches ( 0.8 feet ) by 2030 ( the Rutgers scenario with 50 % chance ) would require a very substantial acceleration for the remainder of the 2020 \u2019 s .\nFigure 4.2 overlays the observed time series since 1980 of sea level on top of the Rutgers sea level rise projections for Atlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2050 are independent of emissions scenario .\nThe solid blue line is the Rutgers ~50 % ; the dash line reflects the likely bounds ( 17-83 % ) and the dotted line reflects the very likely bounds ( 5-95 % ) .\nThe short-term trend in the observed sea level record is dominated by large year-to-year variability .\nThe observed sea level record between the period 2000 and 2020 appears to be tracking between bottom of the likely and very likely ranges of the Rutgers forecast .\nFigure 4.2 : Historic and projected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ axis ) over time ( x axis ) for the period 1980 to 2050 in Atlantic City .\nHistoric data is based on data utilized in figure 4.1 from NOAA tidal records .\nFuture data is based on values found in the Rutgers Report Table 6 .\n4.4 Recommended scenarios of sea level rise for New Jersey Based upon the recent historical record since 2000 , there seems little justification for a 2030 prediction that exceeds the bottom of the likely range ( > 83 % chance exceedance ) .\nFor the period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natural modes of ocean circulation patterns , especially given the current period with the Northeast U.S. coastal \u2018 hot spot.\n\u2019 A further issue of relevance is the influence of these same ocean circulation patterns in the North Atlantic on the mass balance of Greenland .\nThe bottom of the likely range in the Rutgers Report also seems like a good bet out to 2050 .\nFor projections to 2100 , emissions scenario RCP4.5 seems the most appropriate to use .\nHowever as described in Section 2.3 , the projections of sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moderate emissions scenarios do not relate to RCP4.5 .\nThe IPCC \u2019 s projections for RCP4.5 are more consistent with the Rutgers low emissions scenario .\nThe wild card ( potential Dragon King ) and largest uncertainty is associated with a potential large contribution from instability in the West Antarctic ice sheet .\nThe IPCC SROCC assessed this contribution to be considerably lower than that provided by the expert elicitation of Bamber et al .\n( 2019 ) , which is used in the Rutgers Report .\nFor decision making and policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is continued investigation and assessment of the contribution of West Antarctic ice sheet instability under moderate temperature increases associated with emissions scenario RCP4.5 .\nThey key issue is assess whether or not there is a plausible Dragon King scenario that should be considered for the moderate emissions scenario .\nThe sea level projections provided by the Rutgers Report are substantially higher than those provided by the IPCC , which is generally regarded as the authoritative source for policy making .\nThe sea level rise projections provided in the Rutgers Report , if taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premature decisions related to coastal adaptation that are unnecessarily expensive and disruptive .\nThe Rutgers Report develops its own scenarios of sea level rise and does not reference the sea level rise scenarios of the IPCC AR5 , SROCC or the AR6 .\nHowever , the approach used in the Rutgers Report that relies heavily on publications by Kopp et al .\n( 2017 ) and Bamber et al .\n( 2019 ) does not pass muster in the IPCC SROCC ( 2019 ) in context of their choices for sea level rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inadequate data , insufficient understanding , different evaluations of the various classes of evidence , and different logical frameworks for linking the available evidence .\n\u2018 Which experts \u2019 are included in a particular assessment report or expert elicitation makes a difference to the outcome conclusions .\nTherefore , it is important for a practitioner developing scenarios for policy applications to provide context from other assessments ( particularly the IPCC ) and other experts , as well as the temporal rate of change of expert opinion on the topic at hand .\nNone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rutgers Report .\nIndividual experts can be out ahead of the IPCC assessments in developing better scenarios .\nHowever , the CFAN Review does not judge this to be the case with the Rutgers Report .\nThe Rutgers Report characterizes their projections as \u201c Consensus Science to Support Planning for Sea Level Rise in New Jersey.\n\u201d While their projections may reflect a \u2018 consensus \u2019 among the authors of the Rutgers Report , they do not reflect a consensus of international experts on climate change and global sea level rise .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise is better represented by the IPCC assessment reports .\nWell , it will be interesting to see what kind of response my report gets from the Rutgers team and the NJ EPA .\nAs far as I can tell , the points I make are pretty unassailable .\nWe \u2019 ll see .\nBack to the opening statement for this post : The lead authors on the Rutgers Report \u2013 R.

Sweet \u2013 were also lead authors on the 2017 NOAA Report on Sea Level Rise Scenarios and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter on sea level rise .\nKopp is a lead author on the CMIP6 sea level chapter .\nKopp in particular is a prolific publisher on the topic of sea level rise .\nBeing a successful academic is associated with different motives and a different skill set than being a successful practitioner in supporting adaptation decision making .\nRelative to private sector practitioners , academic scientists have no \u2018 skin in the game \u2019 \u2013 there are no adverse consequences for an overconfident forecast with a 5-30 year time horizon that turns out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practitioners in climate services have skin in the game in the sense that they will lose money or go out of business if their confident forecasts turn out to be wrong .\nWhile 80 year predictions are beyond the lifetime of the practitioners and most likely their companies also , the time period for many relevant decisions is the 5-30 year time frame .\nAcademic scientists promote their own research in order to get recognition , promotion , funding etc .\nHowever , this his is not helpful in supporting decision making or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOn the other hand , private sector practitioners will consider any tool that they deem relevant or helpful .\nAnd finally , synthesis and assessment is another skill that runs counter to the normal mode of operation for a research scientist , requiring subsuming one \u2019 s professional ego in context of a broad survey and evaluation of the relevant research .\nIndividual scientists tend not to be very objective about their own research .\nWhile a diverse group of scientists on an assessment panel ( e.g .\nIPCC ) helps ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual \u2019 s own work doesn \u2019 t dominate the assessment , we have certainly seen examples in the past where this is not the case .\nPart III addresses what I have learned about best practices in climate adaptation and how climate science can be useful , based on my real world experience with real world decision making .", "author": "curryja", "url": "https://judithcurry.com/2021/03/08/climate-adaptation-follies-part-ii-scenarios-of-future-sea-level-rise/", "published": "Mon, 08 Mar 2021 15:34:11 +0000", "published_utc": 1615235651, "collection_utc": 1615254590}, {"id": "climateetc--2021-03-13--Week in review \u2013 science edition", "date": "2021-03-13", "source": "climateetc", "title": "Week in review \u2013 science edition", "content": "A few things that caught my eye these past few weeks At the global scale , a decrease in flood probabilities [ link ] How much Arctic fresh water participates in the overturning circulation ?\n[ link ] Simulated stability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation during the Last Glacial Maximum [ link ] No support for the link between conflict and climate change [ link ] Diverging future surface mass balance between the Antarctic ice shelves and grounded ice sheets [ link ] The RAPID observations do not currently exhibit a statistically significant trend in AMOC .\n[ link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifts hint at dramatic dangers [ link ] CMIP6 : Summary of 38 climate model projections of five main scenarios from ScenarioMIP [ link ] \u2018 Comparing tree-ring based reconstructions of snowpack variability at different scales for the Navajo Nation \u2019 [ link ] Are long-term changes in mixed layer depth influencing North Pacific marine heatwaves ?\n[ link ] 1/4 to 1/3 of observed warming trends in China from 1980 to 2015 are attributed to land use changes [ link ] NASA \u2019 s global vegetation Index is up 10 % in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new 500-year reconstruction of Flash Drought in the Central Plains of the US : https : //doi.org/10.1029/2020GL091271\u2026 .\nA 30 yr reconstruction of the AMOC shows no decline [ link ] How can we use all the evidence we have of past extremes to understand ongoing vulnerabilities & prepare for coming climate futures ?\nHow inventories of climate change impacts could look like & be used https : //sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212096321000140 #

Part III:  Dynamic Adaptation Policy Pathways", "content": "This post is the third ( and final ) part in the series on New Jersey sea level rise : The posts are drawn from my report Assessment of projected sea level rise scenarios for the New Jersey coast .\nAs described in Parts I and II , sea level rise projections for the 21st century are characterized by deep uncertainty : \u2022 Deep uncertainty ( recognized ignorance ) \u2013 fundamental uncertainty in the mechanisms being studied and a weak scientific basis for developing scenarios ; future outcomes may lie outside of the realm of regular or quantifiable expectations ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible outcomes .\nApart from uncertainties in emissions scenarios , there are substantial uncertainties in : climate sensitivity to increasing CO2 , future volcanic eruptions , solar variability , multi-decadal ocean oscillations , and possible instabilities in ice sheets .\nKopp et al .\n( 2017 ) state : The following text is drawn from my report \u201c Assessment of projected sea level rise scenarios for the New Jersey Coast \u201d , which includes references .\nMaking good decisions under conditions of deep uncertainty is far more complex than merely selecting the \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is the recommendation provided in the Rutgers Report .\nBecause of the clear expectation for continued sea-level rise , proactive coastal management approaches can be developed and deployed .\nA range of adaptation measures can be used , depending on the local vulnerabilities , land use and nature of the assets at risk : protection , accommodation , reclamation , retreat .\nHowever , the large range of potential future sea levels poses the question : \u201c When and how much to adapt ?\n\u201d Deep uncertainties in the rate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the second half of the century , complicate decision making on coastal adaptation .\nThe deep uncertainty associated with future sea level rise poses substantial challenges for long-lived decisions with high stakes and high sunk ( irreversible ) costs : major infrastructure , building developments and land use planning .\nIf long-term sea level change is not accounted for appropriately , it could mean greater risks , locking into greater costs , or wasted investments .\nUncertainty in climate projections and potential instability in the West Antarctic ice sheet is not expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The challenge facing policy makers is how to make good decisions in the near term , while ensuring that long-term options for addressing uncertain future conditions are not pre-empted or made unnecessarily costly by earlier decisions .\nDeep uncertainty due to climate change requires moving away from the \u2018 predict then act \u2019 paradigm to one of \u2018 robust decision making , \u2019 characterized by continuous learning and dynamic adaptation .\nThe \u2018 dynamic robustness \u2019 approach incorporates flexibility into adaptation plans that can be changed over time as more is learnt or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pathways \u2019 approach ( Ranger et al .\n2013 ) identifies the timing and sequencing of possible \u2018 pathways \u2019 of adaptation measures over time under different scenarios .\nThese concepts have been integrated into an overall \u2018 Dynamic Adaptation Policy Pathways \u2019 ( DAPP ) approach ( Haasnoot et al .\n2013 ) .\nDAPP is a framework for identifying present and future uncertainties , evaluating vulnerabilities and alternative solutions , taking necessary actions in the short term , and monitoring changes and gathering insights that might indicate that new decisions or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning are core elements of the approach .\nIn the DAPP approach , a plan includes an initial action , emphasis on monitoring data , and a series of actions over time ( pathways ) depending on future scenarios that may emerge .\nDAPP is predicated on a strong understanding of the decision problem itself , rather than focusing on climate projections .\nThe decision-centered approach of DAPP focuses on understanding the characteristics of the decision problem ( the objectives and values of stakeholders , trade-offs , constraints and decision criteria ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adaptation options themselves .\nProminent applications of an adaptive approach to uncertain sea level rise include : \u2022 The Thames Estuary study to protect the city of London ( Ranger et al .\n2013 ) \u2022 New Zealand with a national guidance to coastal adaptation ( Bell et al .\n2018 ) \u2022 In the Netherlands an adaptive approach has been put into practice for adaptation to SLR within the Delta Program ( Van Alphen , 2016 ) An example of the DAPP approach applied locally in the U.S. is provided by Obeysekera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for adaptation to sea level rise in the Little River Basin , Miami , Florida .\nAn important conclusion from these studies is that the DAPP approach implies different needs from climate science : \u2022 a shift in emphasis away from probabilistic modeling ; \u2022 improved understanding of relevant processes and their representation in models to enhance \u2018 best guess \u2019 models and to better bound future projections using narrative scenarios .\nIn the decision-centered DAPP approach , scenarios of climate change are not the main driver for the process .\nNevertheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and important role in the decision making process .\nThe Rutgers Report provides a full probability distribution of future sea-level change that incorporates both the likely range and worst-case scenarios , conditional upon an emissions scenario .\nA problem with this approach is that the probability density functions ( PDFs ) are highly conditional on the methods that produced them and provide only a limited sampling of the uncertainties .\nKopp et al .\n( 2019 ) recognizes this by stating : \u201c For processes subject to deep uncertainty , alternative justifiable approaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite divergent answers.\n\u201d While the motivation for probabilistic approaches driven by climate model simulations is to support decision making in the context of cost-benefit analysis , this approach can be counter productive for DAPP ( apart from the issue of non-uniqueness of the probability distribution ) .\nClimate models are at best partial scenario-generators , which is at odds with the requirement of robust decision making to map the range of plausible outcomes .\nFurther , DAPP approaches are scenario neutral , in that decisions do not require information about the probability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith and Stern ( 2011 ) argue that there is value in scientific speculation on policy-relevant aspects of plausible , high-impact scenarios , even though we can neither model them realistically nor provide a precise estimate of their probability .\nA set of narrative scenarios can be formulated that use empirical models and expert judgment to complement outputs from climate models .\nThis approach produces a much wider range of scenarios than would be generated by climate models .\nThe potential problem of generating a plethora of potentially useless future scenarios is avoided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are expected to be significant in a specific decision making context .\nThe objective of DAPP is to develop an iterative , learning decision process that cost-effectively reduces risk today while avoiding foreclosing future options .\nConsidering the full range of plausible scenarios , the DAPP approach provides clear information on the effectiveness and timing of options , enabling analysts to assess under what conditions and on what timescale a plan could fail .\nThe approach explicitly recognizes that adaptation over time will be determined not only by what can be anticipated today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned in the future .\nThe approach ensures that the short- to medium-term plan is set in a framework that will not be maladaptive if climate change progresses at a rate that is different from current expectations .\nDAPP is designed to perform adequately under a wide range of possible future states .\n\u2018 Low-regret \u2019 measures are implemented in the near-term .\nLow-regret measures are those that reduce risk immediately and cost-effectively under a wide range of climate/sea level rise scenarios .\nLow-regret measures can buy time to monitor and learn before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are designed to be adjusted over time as more is learnt about the future .\nIn this way , flexibility is built into the long-term strategy\u2014the timing of new interventions and the interventions themselves can be changed over time .\nDAPP planning provides a framework for incorporating flexibility , so that infrastructure can be adjusted or enhanced in the future at minimal additional cost .\nThis includes include safety margins , where infrastructure is over-engineered to cope with greater than expected change ; this approach is effective where the marginal cost is low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and provides information on when and how decisions should be made .\nThe route-map is used to identify a set of a decision points , triggering specific options or pathways , conditional on observations of sea level rise and other indicators .\nThe DAPP approach is robust not only to climate change , but also to all other sources of risk and uncertainty , including socioeconomic uncertainties and uncertainties resulting from a lack of data .\nAs long as the pathways account for such potential surprises and learning , allowances for adjustment can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in DAPP include a \u2018 likely \u2019 range and estimates of the plausible worst case .\nBest practices in developing scenario outcomes for climate change adaptation start with the scenarios provided by the IPCC assessment reports .\nExperts or other practitioners generating scenario outcomes for a specific application may choose to select specific IPCC scenarios or generate scenarios beyond what the IPCC provides , but these choices should be justified relative to what the IPCC has provided .\nReasons for thinking that climate models are predicting too much warming include : \u2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is less than the average rate of warming predicted by climate models .\n\u2022 The ensemble of climate model simulations does not sample the full range of likely values of equilibrium climate sensitivity , neglecting the lowest 20 % of the likely range from the IPCC AR5 .\n\u2022 Climate models do not include solar variability and volcanic eruptions , with plausible scenarios for a cooling effect in the 21st century .\nIgnoring volcanic eruptions ignores their cooling effects ( Bethge et al , 2017 .\nMost projections of solar variability for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20th century ( Matthes et al .\n2017 ) .\nGiven the implausibility of the RCP8.5 emissions scenario , use of RCP4.5 ( moderate emissions ) is justified by the IEA Report , at least out 2050 .\nSpecifically considering the amount of warming associated with the RCP4.5 scenario , my assessment is that temperature change is very unlikely to exceed the upper bound of the IPCC AR5 likely range , for the reasons cited in the above bullets .\nThe plausible worst-case scenario can play an important role in certain decision making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed in formulating the plausible worst-case outcome so as to be relevant and useful for decision makers .\nOutcomes of future climate change are associated with deep uncertainty , and plausible outcomes ( especially on the high end ) are weakly constrained .\nExperts inevitably disagree on what constitutes a plausible worst-case scenario when the knowledge base is uncertain ( Bamber et al .\n2019 is a case in point ) .\nCurry ( 2019 ) has developed a classification of worst-case scenarios based on the extent to which borderline implausible parameters or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via physical or mental models .\nThis classification is inspired by the Queen in \u201c Alice in Wonderland : \u201d \u201c Why , sometimes I \u2019 ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.\n\u201d This classification articulates three categories of worst-case scenarios : \u2022 Conceivable worst case : formulated by incorporating all worst-case parameters/inputs into a model ; the outcome does not survive refutation efforts .\n\u2022 Possible worst case ( borderline impossible ) : Includes multiple worst-case parameters/inputs in model-derived scenarios ; the outcome survives refutation efforts ( at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case : Includes at most one borderline implausible assumption in model-derived scenarios .\nThe plausible worst-case scenario is most relevant for decision making .\nCandidates for the plausible worst-case scenario can be evaluated by assessing the input assumptions and parameters that are used in developing the scenario .\nInevitably , there will be disagreement as to what constitutes an implausible input , and hence there is a range of candidate worst-case scenarios to consider .\nA \u2018 black swan event \u2019 ( Taleb , 2007 ) is a metaphor that describes an event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major effect , and is often inappropriately rationalized after the fact with the benefit of hindsight .\nIn assessing the climate change impacts on sea level rise and coastal storms , attempts are made to foresee worst-case scenarios .\nThere are two different types of plausible worst-case scenarios of relevance to the assessment of coastal threats from climate change : \u2022 Gray swan : a high-impact event that may be foreseeable using historical data combined with physical knowledge .\nGray swan scenarios are of relevance for worst-case impacts from a single landfalling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) \u2022 Dragon King : an event that is extremely large in size or impact , occurring in nonlinear and complex systems that is generated from positive feedbacks , tipping points , bifurcations , regime shifts .\nBy understanding the underlying dynamics , there may be some potential predictability .\nMajor instabilities in West Antarctic ice sheet fall into the Dragon King category ( Sornette , 2009 ) .\nGray swans are somewhat different from Dragon Kings in that our understanding is sufficient to formulate plausible gray swan scenarios of individual extreme events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event arising from instability or a regime shift .\nA number of different scenarios should be formulated for plausible gray swan and Dragon King events .\nProbability distributions can be formulated for gray swan and Dragon King events , based on a distribution of inputs .\nHowever , it is important to keep in mind that such probability distributions do not relate directly to outcomes , but rather to the plausibility of the individual scenarios as the worst case .\nFor Dragon Kings , any estimated probabilities will evolve with increasing knowledge .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a Dragon King event could occur , it is best for decision making purposes if the distribution for the Dragon King regime are presented separately from the probabilities for the range of outcomes that are better understood ( Ranger et al 2013 ) .\nWhile speculative scenarios can be useful in support of the decision making process , formulation of the plausible worst case scenario ( s ) for decision making applications requires justification for the assumptions that went into the model ( physical or mental ) , including the plausibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bamber et al .\n( 2019 ) expert elicitation that was used in the Rutgers Report is that the individual respondents were not required to provide justification for their predicted outcomes .\nDue to ignorance , misaligned incentives , and cognitive biases , there is often a failure to adequately anticipate Dragon King and gray swan events .\nHowever , when explicit efforts are undertaken to anticipate such events , their importance and likelihood can be over-emphasized and there is a great deal of uncertainty and speculation that needs to be acknowledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Antarctic ice sheet The primary concern over future sea level rise in the 21st century is related to potential dynamical instabilities in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet .\nThe West Antarctic Ice Sheet rests on bedrock below sea level , making the ice sheet vulnerable to melting from the ocean .\nIf these marine ice shelves \u2013 the floating extensions of glacial ice flowing into the ocean \u2013 lose mass , their buttressing capacity is reduced , accelerating seaward ice flow .\nThis self-sustaining process is known as Marine Ice Sheet Instability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2013 ) has medium confidence that this additional contribution from the West Antarctic ice sheet would not exceed several tenths of a meter of sea level rise during the 21st century [ IPCC AR5 WG1 Chapter 13 ] .\nSubsequent to the IPCC AR5 , there has been considerable focus on the worst-case scenario for global sea level rise , and our \u2018 background knowledge \u2019 is rapidly changing .\nDeConto and Pollard ( 2016 ) articulated a mechanism whereby disappearance of ice shelves allows formation of ice cliffs , which may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to generate stresses that exceed the strength of the ice .\nThis ice cliff failure can lead to ice sheet retreat via a process called marine ice cliff instability ( MICI ) , that is hypothesized to cause partial collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet with increased warming .\nThe IPCC SROCC ( 2019 ) provides an updated summary on the potential contribution of dynamical instabilities in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to global sea level rise .\nThe IPCC SROCC assessed the amount of sea level rise increase from dynamical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be 16 centimeters ( range : 2\u201337 cm ) .\nThe SROCC notes that the expert elicitation approach ( Bamber et al.\n, 2019 ; used in the Rutgers Report ) suggests considerably higher values for sea level rise from the West Antarctic ice sheet than provided in Table 4.3 of the IPCC SROCC .\nIf RCP8.5 is assumed to be implausible and the focus is on the moderate emissions scenarios ( RCP4.5 ) , what constitutes the plausible worst-case scenario for sea level rise ?\nSpecifically with regards to the DeConto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily influenced the Rutgers Report , the SROCC makes the following statement : A recent publication by Donat-Magnin et al .\n( 2021 ) uses improved estimates of surface melt rates , and finds that for RCP4.5 only the Abbot glacier in the Amundsen sector is expected to become unstable to hydrofracturing ( the DeConto-Pollard mechanism ) during the 21st century .\nEdwards et al .\n( 2019 ) further supports at most a small contribution in the 21st century from RCP4.5 for the DeConto-Pollard mechanism .\nSpecifically with regards to the Marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DeConto and Pollard ( 2016 ) , the IPCC SROCC makes the following statement : At this point , there isn \u2019 t an obviously plausible Dragon King scenario for sea level rise in the 21st century under RCP4.5 .\nSuperstorm Sandy and the 1893 hurricane striking New Jersey are reminders that a storm nominally having Category 1 force winds can produce a greater storm surge and overall more damage than a more intense Category 3 hurricane .\nThe strong surge from Sandy was associated with extratropical transition and its subsequent very large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly struck the coast , and landfall at high tide .\nSandy was not a worst-case scenario for New Jersey ; a substantially higher storm surge ( estimated at 13 feet ) occurred for the 1821 Cape May hurricane .\nIf the 1821 hurricane had occurred at high tide , slower forward motion and with a larger horizontal extent , the storm tide would have been substantially higher .\nLin and Emanuel ( 2015 ) define \u2018 gray swan \u2019 hurricanes as high-impact storms that would not be predicted based on history but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with historical data .\nThere are several strategies for generating scenarios of gray swan hurricanes that should be considered in assessing risks impacting the New Jersey coast : \u2022 Consider the occurrences of previous storms in the historical , archaeological and geologic records that impacted the mid-Atlantic states .\nIf it has happened before , it can happen again .\n\u2022 Synthetic scenarios can be created by combining plausible worst-case storm elements into individual scenarios .\n\u2022 The intensity ( maximum wind speed ) can be increased by 5 % and 10 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on hurricane intensity .\nIn developing grey swan scenarios of relevance to storm surge in a particular location , the following storm parameters can be varied within a physically plausible range : \u2022 Intensity ( maximum winds ) : up to Category 4 ( a category 5 landfall as far north as New Jersey is judged to implausible ) .\n\u2022 Horizontal size : up to the size of Hurricane Sandy , although such a large horizontal size is inconsistent with the strongest hurricane intensities .\n\u2022 Speed of forward motion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surge .\n\u2022 Angle of approach to the coastline : the straight east-west track is the worst case for NJ .\n\u2022 Time of landfall relative to the astronomical tide : high tide is worst case .\nDAPP frameworks have mostly been applied to more gradual shifts of climate change , rather than extreme and abrupt changes .\nHasnoot et al .\n( 2020 ) addresses the concern of adaptation for extreme scenarios of sea level change from instability of the West Antarctic ice sheet ( a Dragon King scenario ) that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change .\nSuch an event would be associated with a short time to adapt , which can have large consequences for decision making .\nHasnoot et al .\n( 2020 ) identify the decision making challenges arising from potentially accelerated sea level rise .\nDecisions may need to be taken when there is still large uncertainty about the sea level rise at the end of the envisioned lifetime and the lead time of follow-up interventions .\nThe time required for planning and implementation can be decades for large coastal defense projects and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are designed for a lifetime exceeding a century .\nMost coastal defense and major infrastructure decisions have a long lifetime and can not easily be solved with incremental or flexible measures , and these decisions will thus have to account for high amounts of sea level rise at once .\nWorst-case sea level rise scenarios can be used to assess under what conditions alternative adaptation pathways are needed , which can help to prepare and enable timely adaptation .\nThis can be accomplished through flexible measures and preparatory actions to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for future options ) , and in the design of structures to enable long-term adaptation ( e.g .\na large foundation of a structure to build higher later ) .\nThe time horizon of a pathways study should be chosen by considering the envisioned functional lifetime .\nFor decisions with a long lifetime ( > 100 years ) , the focus should not be on projections of sea level rise for a specific time horizon .\nWhen looking at longer time horizons , it is more useful to consider the perspective that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whether SLR will rise to certain levels , but when this will occur .\nThis perspective may help to overcome decision paralysis due to uncertainty .\nJC \u2019 s reflections on best practices for adaptation I have been working in the climate adaptation space since 1999 , mostly through my company Climate Forecast Applications Network ( CFAN ) , but also on several university-based projects prior to 2006 ( when CFAN was formed ) .\nDuring this period I have worked with development banks , corporations , government agencies ( local/state/national ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of different projects in different sectors and for different countries that address different types of vulnerabilities .\nThe single biggest problem that I see in climate adaptation is getting the climate community ( broadly defined as scientists and adaptation decision makers ) to move away from the \u2018 predict then act \u2019 paradigm .\nApart from potentially misleading the decision making process , the \u2018 predict then act \u2019 paradigm places undue emphasis on the \u2018 correctness \u2019 of the prediction .\nThis gives rise to acrimonious disagreements and motivates the \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagreement by the climate establishment , all in the name of promoting good decision making .\nBy contrast , robust decision making approaches explicitly welcome ( and actively seek ) all plausible scenarios , rendering most disagreements about projected outcomes to be moot .\nThe second biggest problem is the perceived urgency of action , which exacerbates the problems associated with \u2018 predict then act.\n\u2019 The incremental approach of robust decision making builds in flexibility to the adaptation planning .\nThe decision-centric mode that characterizes robust decision making focuses scenarios around specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nToo often , climate adaptation interventions focus excessively on climate change and less on examinations of what drives local vulnerability .\nReducing vulnerability is the central criterion of adaptation success .\nTop down interventions by development banks or U.N. agencies have many well-documented failures , owing to failures to consult adequately with local stakeholders and to truly understand the causes of local vulnerabilities ( both environmental and societal ) .\nAnd finally , it needs to be re-emphasized that climate models aren \u2019 t particularly useful at generating future outcomes of regional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are targets of adaptation .\nHence narrative scenarios developed from historical/paleo data and guided by simple process models and climate model simulations provide a much richer set of scenarios .\nWhich experts are used in developing scenarios also matters quite a bit to the suite of scenarios that are provided .\nBest practice is to use 2 to 3 different teams with different perspectives/expertise in generating scenarios and evaluating scenarios of the other teams .\nI have been involved in three projects that used the multiple teams approach , and all parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with a much better understanding of the uncertainties and different factors in play .", "author": "curryja", "url":

0.53 W/m2 increase in TOA radiative forcing since 2003 ?\nhttps : //twitter.com/curryja/status/1375144537522204672 She asks it in relation with a recent article accepted for publication on Observational evidence of increasing global radiative forcing ( Kramer et al.\n, 2021 ) .\nAbstract .\n\u201c Changes in atmospheric composition , such as increasing greenhouse gases , cause an initial radiative imbalance to the climate system , quantified as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not been directly observed globally and previous estimates have come from models .\nIn part , this is because current space\u2010based instruments can not distinguish the instantaneous radiative forcing from the climate \u2019 s radiative response .\nWe apply radiative kernels to satellite observations to disentangle these components and find all\u2010sky instantaneous radiative forcing has increased 0.53\u00b10.11 W/m2 from 2003 through 2018 , accounting for positive trends in the total planetary radiative imbalance .\nThis increase has been due to a combination of rising concentrations of well\u2010mixed greenhouse gases and recent reductions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinct fingerprints of anthropogenic activity in Earth \u2019 s changing energy budget , which we find observations can detect within 4 years.\n\u201d This question touches a central point of climate science because it can not be an experimental science in which one can play with parameters in isolation from each other .\nOnly a few limited ongoing instrumental observations and palaeolithic reconstructions may serve to try to distinguish natural from anthropogenic processes , in particular radiative forcing processes .\nHowever , most of this job , if not all of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also be formulated in a more general way : Is it at all possible , at global scope and by instrumental observations , to distinguish the causes of radiative forcing difference of 0.53 W\u00b7m-2 over a time period of 15 years ?\n\u2022 From a simple , two-layer energy balance budget it can be estimated that , all other things remaining constant , a 1 % increase in cloudiness ( which amounts to approx .\n66 % overall ) may induce a temperature increase of 0.54 \u00b0C at the Earth surface and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere ( TOA ) \u2022 Without consideration for any system feedback , a radiative forcing of 0.53 Wm-2 would induce a temperature rise of 0.11 \u00b0C at the surface , and 0.18 \u00b0C at TOA .\n\u2022 To obtain a same temperature increase , thus to respond to a forcing of 0.53 Wm-\u20112 , it would take a change in cloudiness by 0.27 % for the surface , or by 0.4 % for the TOA .\n\u2022 Is cloudiness , or change of cloudiness , measurable with such accuracy and precision at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2003 , and in 2018 ?\nFrom an overall energy balance perspective : \u2022 In general , and to simplify , modelers estimate all incoming and outgoing heat fluxes , and let any remaining quantity warm or cool the oceans , thus reporting a so-called accumulated ocean heat or \u201c heat content anomaly \u201d .\nAccording to NASA , over the 1993\u20132019 period , a heat flux anomaly of 0.36 to 0.41 Wm-2 for the first 700 m of depth would have accumulated .\nOver time , other heat release periods should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not let us boil or freeze for ever ( it never did ) .\n\u2022 Over this time period of 26 years , this heat flux would have implied a temperature change to a well homogenized 700-meter water column of 0.10 to 0.11 \u00b0C , a hard to measure change .\n\u2022 A question , similar to the previous one , arises regarding instrumental observation : is it at all possible to measure such heat accumulation precisely , accurately , and at the aggregated global scope ( by localized

driver of environmental regulation in New York .\nA new report \u201c The Fossil Fuel End Game , A frontline vision to retire New York City \u2019 s peaker plants by 2030 \u201d illustrates the campaign strategy they are using to shut down peaking power plants in New York City .\nUnfortunately their claims are based more on emotion than fact .\nIn the spring of 2020 Physicians , Scientists , and Engineers ( PSE ) for Healthy Energy released a report Opportunities for Replacing Peaker Plants with Energy Storage in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York specific report describes the alleged problem : Across New York , 49 oil- and gas-fired peaker power plants and peaking units at larger plants help meet statewide peak electric demand .\nThese include both combustion turbines designed to ramp quickly to meet peak demand , and aging steam turbines now used infrequently to meet peak needs .\nMore than a third of New York \u2019 s peaker plants burn primarily oil , and three-quarters are over 30 years old resulting in numerous inefficient plants with high rates of greenhouse gas and criteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generated .\nSome of these plants are in very urban areas : ten plants have more than a million people living within three miles .\nOne-third of the plants are located in areas the state considers to be environmental justice communities , where vulnerable populations typically already experience high levels of health and environmental burdens .\nNew York has set energy storage targets and recently designed peaker plant emission reduction targets , providing an opportunity to replace inefficient , high-emitting peaker plants in vulnerable communities throughout the state with energy storage and solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the New York City PEAK Coalition .\nThey released a report in June 2020 entitled : \u201c Dirty Energy , Big Money \u201d .\nMost recently they followed up with The Fossil Fuel End Game , a frontline vision to retire New York City \u2019 s peaking power plants by 2030 .\nThe campaign is succeeding because the New York Senate passed the Pollution Justice Act of 2021 on March 3 , 2021 that mandates that the peaking power plants have to be retired consistent with these reports .\nThis campaign is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The premise is wrong because peaking power plants are not inherently bad because they provide critical support to the electric system when needed most and that will be the focus of this post .\nThe rationale is incorrect that these peaking power plants are directly affecting air quality in adjacent environmental justice neighborhoods because the health impacts are claimed from secondary pollutants that do not form before they are transported away from the neighborhood .\nReplacing all the peaking plants in the time frame as suggested is extremely risky because the technology available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn this post I am going to concentrate on the reason for peaking power plants rather than the holes in the environmental arguments against them .\nFor more information on those aspects , I refer readers to posts on my blog .\nThe first post on the Peak Coalition report provided information on the primary air quality problem associated with these facilities , the organizations behind the report , the State \u2019 s response to date , the underlying issue of environmental justice and addressed the motivation for the analysis .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the proposed plan relative to environmental effects , affordability , and reliability .\nI also discussed the original report Opportunities for Replacing Peaker Plants with Energy Storage in New York State document that provided technical information used by the PEAK Coalition .\nI summarized all three of these technical posts in simpler fashion .\nI looked at the trends of inhalable particulates in New York City relative to the claims of a dire health threat .\nFinally , I recently wrote a post on the Pollution Justice Act .\nNew York has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inefficient and dirty combustion turbines that are a real problem .\nI believe it is more appropriate to allow the load-serving entities , generators , and system operators to consider alternatives and implement proven solutions that are cost-effective and enhance rather than risk reliability with new alternatives until those alternatives have been fully vetted .\nThere is a long history of blackouts in New York City ( NYC ) .\nAfter a blackout in July 2019 AMNY published a brief history of blackouts in New York City .\nIn 1959 and 1961 surges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The outage spurred changes to better protect the city \u2019 s power grid from future blackouts \u201d .\nThe 1965 blackout was the first regional blackout and was caused by a transmission problem in Ontario causing a wave of disruptions in the transmission system .\nOver 30 million people and 80,000 square miles in Ontario , New York , Connecticut , Massachusetts , New Hampshire , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , and Vermont were left without power for up to 13 hours .\nAs part of the response to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool to manage electricity generation and transmission .\nThe over-arching issue for electricity reliability in New York City is geography .\nMost of New York City is on islands so there is a natural load pocket .\nThere was another blackout in 1977 that was limited to NYC directly related to the load pocket .\nIt was caused by storms cutting off transmission into the City and in-City generation being unable to replace the load .\nWithout sufficient local power , protective devices turn off overloaded lines and transformers to prevent physical damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outages .\nAs a result of this blackout , reliability constraints were implemented to ensure that when storms threaten transmission into the City that sufficient in-City generation is available to prevent a re-occurrence .\nIn 2003 there was another regional blackout caused by a computer software problem .\nGrid operators identified the cause and then developed procedures to prevent it from happening again .\nIn 2012 tropical storm Sandy caused massive blackouts exacerbated by flood protection weaknesses .\nSince then , there have been massive investments to strengthen the infrastructure to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackout the electric system owners and operators have developed strategies to prevent a reoccurrence .\nThe New York State Reliability Council is an independent entity \u201c whose mission is to promote and preserve the reliability of electric service on the New York State Power System by developing , maintaining , and , from time-to-time , updating the Reliability Rules which shall be complied with by the New York Independent System Operator ( \u201c NYISO \u201d ) and all entities engaging in electric transmission , ancillary services , energy and power transactions on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among their rules that govern reliability are those that address the strategies developed after these blackouts .\nIt turns out that that New York City \u2019 s peaking power plants are part of those strategies and are needed to provide additional in-City generation within short periods of time .\nReleasing the report less than a month since the Texas energy debacle should give pause to the organizers of this campaign to consider the ramifications of what happened there to New York reliability requirements .\nWhile there have been reports that dozens of deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , experts say the death toll is likely far larger .\nJust how many won \u2019 t be known for weeks or months .\nThe blackouts cost the state economy upward of $ 130 billion in damages and losses , and some people who did have power saw their bills spike by thousands of dollars .\nGrid operators say that the situation could actually have been a lot worse , with the system minutes away from a months long blackout .\nClearly the history of blackouts shows that they pose an enormous risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The report claims to be the \u201c first detailed strategic and policy road map to retire and replace an entire city \u2019 s fossil-fuel peaker power plants \u201d .\nIt lays out a community-led strategy to replace about half of New York City \u2019 s existing fleet of polluting peaker plants with a combination of offshore wind , distributed solar , energy efficiency , and battery storage by 2025 .\nThey claim that the remaining peaker plants could be reliably and cost-effectively replaced with this mix of resources by 2030 .\nIn order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand how they think peaking plants are used .\nThe report points out that : \u201c Electricity from peaker plants is the most expensive energy resource in the system as it comes from centrally-located assets that are used infrequently but must be paid for and maintained to allow availability at times of peak demand .\nCentral location , low utilization and the need for technologies that provide flexibility drive the costs of generation way above those from other energy assets .\nFor this reason , peaker owners charge for the electricity they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge for the availability of their resources during system peaks .\nSuch availability is paid through the capacity market , designed to ensure that the system has enough capacity to provide energy during the times of highest energy demand .\nWhile NYC is not the only region with a capacity market , it has some of the highest capacity prices in the country .\nWhen capacity costs are averaged over the hours of operation , peaker electricity in New York City is up to 1,300 % more expensive than the average cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d It is frustrating to me that the authors don \u2019 t recognize the value of assets that provide power when it is needed most .\nIt is also telling that Texas does not have a capacity market .\nIn order to ensure power is available whenever it is needed ratepayers have to cover the costs for that availability .\nIn that light the relatively low costs of Texas electricity do not appear to be such a good deal now .\nThe report goes on : Another factor that makes peaker energy more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by technological limitations and distribution constraints .\nFor example , there are costs associated with turning on and off certain generating assets that lead plant managers to run them at uneconomic times , driving up consumer costs and increasing local emissions .\nFrom a market perspective , peakers are also called to run uneconomically to ensure local reliability .\nAccording to the state \u2019 s Market Monitor , Potomac Economics , supplemental commitment of NYC \u2019 s peakers occurs frequently to increase the amount of supply available in real-time for local load pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are enough resources to meet load in case of a problem such as the loss of the two largest Bulk Power System elements supporting a particular load pocket , for example , the loss of multiple central generators due to contingencies in the natural gas system .\nThis supplemental commitment tends to undermine market incentives for efficiently meeting reliability requirements and often uplifts market prices , which are eventually passed on to customers .\nSome of these costs could be alleviated through market reforms or through deployment of modern inverter-based resources like locally-sited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserves in these load pockets .\nIn 2019 , NYC accounted for 87 percent of the State \u2019 s total reliability commitment .\nThese factors are outside my area of expertise but it is my understanding that many of these issues are legacies from the switch from a regulated , vertically integrated utility to New York \u2019 s de-regulated market .\nConsolidated Edison designed the generation , transmission , and distribution system when they were responsible for all three aspects of the system .\nWhen the market was de-regulated ownership of these assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency .\nAnecdotally I have heard from colleagues that it is not clear how these units are dispatched so I suspect at least some of these criticisms have merit .\nThe report acknowledges that \u201c peakers play an important role in supporting reliable electric service for New Yorkers \u201d and points out that some of them also \u201c produce steam that feeds the city \u2019 s \u201c district heating \u201d system , providing heat and cooling to many buildings in Manhattan \u201d .\nHowever , the report offers no recommendations how the steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology .\nThe analysis evaluates historical data to develop a replacement plan : \u201c More specifically , the peaker fleet was analyzed on a unit-by-unit , hourly basis using historic generation profiles as reported to the EPA for the years 2017 , 2018 and 2019 \u201d .\nTherein lies the a problem .\nThey argue that over those three years the full capacity of the fleet of peakers in New York City has not been required to meet peaking needs in NYC but because New York \u2019 s reliability rules are based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their time frame is too short .\nThey also argue that \u201c In 2018 , the year with the most challenging peak , only 4,790 MW out of 6,200 MW ( or about 77 % of total peaking capacity ) was ever used simultaneously .\nMoreover , more than half of the peaker fleet is rarely used simultaneously , in fact , this only happened during 44 hours of the year ( 0.5 % of the time ) and in very short event durations.\n\u201d They also analyze operating characteristics .\n\u201c An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duration showed that many of the peakers run for relatively short durations that could be served by energy storage at competitive costs \u201d .\nAs mentioned before , the short duration of their evaluation period makes these findings weak .\nThe short-comings of the NYC transmission and distribution system also affect peaker operations and further reduce the credibility of these findings .\nThe consultant who did the work , Strategen , \u201c used a 90th percentile approach on duration to determine the replacement needs of NYC fossil assets while taking in consideration five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of peakers in a traditional \u201c longest peaker runtime \u201d approach .\nThese include 1 ) peaker unit dispatch versus available zone level capacity , 2 ) peaker unit dispatch versus plant level capacity , 3 ) peaker unit dispatch for localized non-peaking needs , 3 ) inconsistent levels of peaker output during longer-runtimes , and 5 ) unit operational constraints.\n\u201d There is no question in my mind that this approach under estimates the worst case .\nFor heaven \u2019 s sakes they are saying don \u2019 t worry about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time they are addressing peaking units that run less than 5 % of the time .\n\u201c Assuming a 90-percentile approach on unit duration to account for system characteristics and its reliability needs \u201d , Stategen determined that \u201c 28 units with 765 MW of installed capacity have maximum durations of four hours or less , making them attractive candidates for replacement with storage even in a 1-to-1 basis \u201d .\nThe proposed solution is replacement with energy storage that has a cap on how long power can be provided so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider that energy storage discharge capacities are not 100 % , and overlooks life expectancy of batteries two or three times less compared to a fossil generator .\nThere are 52 other peaking turbines that ran for longer durations which only exacerbates the limitations .\nFinally , they propose to replace nine large steam units , accounting for 3,882 MW or 64 % of the total fleet capacity .\nThese units \u201c have maximum dispatch durations that go from 80 to 1,500 hours but are also the perfect example of over-dispatch driven by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be purpose-built for their present role but they provide dispatchable , in-city power from small foot print facilities and can produce firm dispatchable power for very long periods .\nAccording to the report \u2019 s overview : \u201c The report lays out a plan for New York City focused on local , distributed solutions .\nThis decentralized approach creates a more resilient power system than the current grid , which depends on centralized fossil-fuel power plants.\n\u201d The \u201c Clean Energy Vision for New York City \u201d depends on four resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solar , energy efficiency and energy storage .\nI will address each below .\nDespite the fact that there hasn \u2019 t been any offshore wind development so far , the vision counts on this resource and expects that it can be developed faster than proposed .\nNew York State has a goal to develop 9 GW of offshore wind by 2035 .\nI have not seen whether this resource will be considered \u201c in-city \u201d .\nIf not and I would argue that it isn \u2019 t , then this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved four projects and needs to develop infrastructure to support building those projects , I suspect that development will take longer than proposed .\nThe report recognizes that there are inherent difficulties siting solar in NYC : \u201c New York City is afflicted with many of the canonical challenges that inhibit rooftop solar development including challenging local regulation , shared rooftop space , a significant population that rents , and aging buildings and electrical infrastructure \u201d .\nBecause they claim there is a lot of value in having it , they blithely assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume that 5.4 GW of solar can be developed in NYC .\nThe analysis relies on energy efficiency to markedly reduce energy use in order to reduce the energy needed during peak periods .\nThere is a complicating factor that I don \u2019 t think they address .\nNew York \u2019 s climate legislation mandates electrification of everything to meet its 2050 zero-emissions goal .\nAs a result , heating and transportation will have to be electrified and all analysts agree that means that the annual peak load will shift from the summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter when it can not .\nThe biggest problem I have is with their analysis of energy storage .\nThey used a linear energy dispatch model to determine how much storage is needed to replace peaker plant generation for their plan .\nIn their methodology \u201c Energy storage was modeled to provide energy arbitrage services , that is , storing clean energy when it is produced but not used , and discharging it into the grid at times of need.\n\u201d Aside from the practical matter that the quantity of energy storage requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the crowded city there are other concerns .\nThey only used a single year for the analysis and there is no suggestion that discharge capacity limits were considered .\nThe analysis does not recognize that in order to replace fossil peakers two types of energy storage are needed .\nLonger-duration storage needs to cover , for example , night time for solar resources .\nThat appears to be the storage addressed .\nHowever , fossil-fired combustion turbines used for peaking operate at fixed loads but solar resources , for example vary if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therefore , energy resources are needed for this short-term variation .\nBut that \u2019 s not all .\nFossil units also provide ancillary services such as frequency control .\nThe point is that they did not calculate how much energy storage has to be allocated for these other services .\nThere is another flaw in this approach .\nThey looked at the characteristics of energy load and how peaking units provided that energy and proposed a solution based on off-shore wind and solar resources assuming that those resources would be available .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortcomings in New York \u2019 s implementation process is that have not yet done an evaluation of the availability of wind and solar at the same time over a long period .\nTo date the primary planning problem has always been the peak load but it is conceivable that the bigger problem for a future grid reliant upon wind and solar will be low coincidental resource availability .\nHowever , because the peak loads are associated with the coldest and hottest weather and those periods are associated with high pressure system with light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renewable resource availability will be worst when it is needed most .\nIn any event , the Strategen analysis did not consider resource availability at all .\nEven though there are other shortcomings in the analysis , this post is too long so I will wrap it up .\nAt this time , environmental justice organization are conducting a well-orchestrated effort to replace peaking power plants in New York City .\nNew York energy and environmental policy initiatives are catering to these organizations and the New York Senate has even passed a law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this approach will become evident on the national level soon .\nThere are many inherent advantages to fossil-fired power plants .\nIn the New York City context , they provide reliable power when needed from relatively small footprints and are a key component to the reliability standards developed from hard experience .\nUnfortunately , the arguments to replace them are based more on emotion than fact and seem to be driven by the urge to eliminate one over hyped risk while ignoring the unintended consequences of their solutions which may create other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In my opinion , it is particularly troubling that the problem of peaking power plants has already being addressed .\nLast summer New York promulgated rules to replace the old , inefficient and dirty combustion turbines that are a real problem .\nThis study and others expand the definition of peaking power plants to other units that can not be replaced easily .\nI think that the organizations behind this report are unwilling to accept any perceived risks from new efficient and clean fossil generating plants partially based on the na\u00efve belief that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political will .\nGiven that political policy decisions played a hand in the recent Texas energy debacle , I think that is a dangerous path to take .\nRoger Caiazza blogs on New York energy and environmental issues at Pragmatic Environmentalist

the same direction .\n\u2013 policy scientist Daniel Sarewitz \u201c This is the big problem in science that no one is talking about : even an honest person is a master of self-deception .\nIn today \u2019 s environment , our talent for jumping to conclusions makes it all too easy to find false patterns in randomness , to ignore alternative explanations for a result or to accept \u2018 reasonable \u2019 outcomes without question \u2014 that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without realizing it.\n\u201d Psychologists Richard Simmons et al .\nfind that researcher bias can have a profound influence on the outcome of a study .\nSuch \u2018 researcher degrees of freedom \u2019 include choices about which variables to include , which data to include , which comparisons to make , and which analysis methods to use .\nEach of these choices may be reasonable , but when added together they allow for researchers to extract statistical significance or other meaningful information out of almost any data set .\nResearchers making necessary choices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are making the correct , or at least reasonable , choices .\nBut their bias will influence those choices in ways that researchers may not be aware of .\nFurther , researchers may simply be using the techniques that work \u2013 meaning they give the results the researcher wants .\nThe objective of scientific research is to find out what is really true , not just verify our biases .\nIf a community of scientists has a diversity of perspectives and different biases , then the checks and balances in the scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biases of individuals .\nSometimes this is true\u2014but often this does not happen quickly or smoothly .\nNot only can poor data and wrong ideas survive , but good ideas can be suppressed .\nHowever , when biases caused by motivated reasoning and career pressures become entrenched in the institutions that support science \u2013 the professional societies , scientific journals , universities and funding agencies \u2013 then that subfield of science may be led astray for decades .\nConsensus is viewed as a proxy for truth in many discussions of science .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ free deliberations of many is a strong indicator of truth .\nHowever , a consensus can only be trusted to the extent that individuals are free to disagree with it .\nA scientific argument can evolve prematurely into a ruling theory if cultural forces are sufficiently strong and aligned in the same direction .\nPremature theories enforced by an explicit consensus building process harm scientific progress because of the questions that don \u2019 t get asked and the investigations that aren \u2019 t undertaken .\nNuzzio ( 2015 ) refers to this as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scientific research is to obtain truth and avoid error , how might a consensus seeking process introduce bias into the science and increase the chances for error ?\n\u2018 Confirmation bias \u2019 is a well-known psychological principle that connotes the seeking or interpretation of evidence in ways that are partial to existing beliefs , expectations , or an existing hypothesis .\nConfirmation bias usually refers to unwitting selectivity in the acquisition and interpretation of evidence .\nPhilosopher Thomas Kelly ( 2005 ) provides the following insight into confirmation bias .\nAs more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given issue , the proportion of the total evidence which consists of higher order psychological evidence of what other people believe increases , and the proportion of the total evidence which consists of first order evidence decreases .\nKelly concludes that over time , this invisible hand process tends to bestow a certain competitive advantage to our prior beliefs with respect to confirmation and disconfirmation .\nAllen et al .\n( 2020 ) demonstrate how dependence , pressure , and polarization can force a consensus , making reliance on consensus as an indicator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a consensus can only be trusted to the extent that individuals are free to disagree with it , without repression or reprisal .\nSimilarly , when strong incentives favor affirmation of a position , a consensus affirming it becomes almost inevitable , and therefore all but meaningless .\nCommunication theorist Jean Goodwin argues that once the consensus claim was made , scientists involved in the ongoing IPCC process had reasons not just to consider the scientific evidence , but also to consider the possible effect of their statements on their ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s consensus-building process arguably promotes groupthink .\n\u2018 Groupthink \u2019 is a pattern of thought characterized by self-deception , forced manufacture of consent , and conformity to group values .\nJanis ( 1972 ) describes eight symptoms of groupthink : Many defenders of the IPCC consensus \u2212 both scientists and consensus entrepreneurs \u2212 show many if not all of these symptoms .\nThomas Gold ( 1989 ) discussed the dangers that \u2018 herd behavior \u2019 poses for scientists , potentially leading to an inertia-driven persistence of false consensus opinion within the sciences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sociological behavior , it has been a disaster in science \u2212 in science what we generally want is diversity .\nWhen people pursue the same avenue all together , they tend to shut out other avenues , and they are not always on the right ones .\nIt is not just the herd instinct in the individuals that is of concern .\nIf support from peers and moral and financial consequences are at stake , then staying with the herd is the successful policy for the individual ; however , it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science .\nMental herd behavior , even if it does not actually put a clamp upon free thinking , insidiously applies pressure to follow the fashion .\nThe institutions that support of science \u2212 financial support , the journals , the judgment of referees , the invitations to conferences , professional recognition \u2212 are all influenced by herd behavior .\nEconomist William Butos ( 2015 ) characterizes the IPCC as a \u2018 Big Player \u2019 in science in that it possesses all of the attributes characteristic of Big Players in markets : bigness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual constraints , and discretion in its ability to promote a favored direction of research .\nThis characterization of the IPCC as \u2018 Big Player \u2019 is similar to economist Richard Tol \u2019 s characterization of the IPCC as a knowledge monopoly .\nThe IPCC \u2019 s influence in climate science is pervasive , allowing it to largely ignore the usual scientific constraints on the acceptance of hypotheses .\nProfessional success in climate science has become more tied to the acceptance of the IPCC \u2019 s pronouncements than with the exploration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IPCC as a \u2018 big player \u2019 and a \u2018 knowledge monopoly \u2019 on climate change can lead to premature canonization of IPCC conclusions .\nPremature canonization refers to widespread scientific belief in a false or incomplete conclusion , which leads to suppression masquerading as rejection .\nSuppression occurs when the fear of social sanctions prevents ideas from being explored or empirical findings from being presented in scientific or public forums .\nIn science , rejection occurs when an idea has been explored and the evidence has been found wanting .\nA classic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involves the scientific identification of causes of ulcers .\nSo what are the implications of these concerns for the IPCC \u2019 s consensus on human-caused climate change ?\nCognitive biases in the context of an institutionalized consensus building process have arguably resulted in the consensus becoming increasingly confirmed , and even canonized , in a self-reinforcing way .\nAn extended group of scientists derive their confidence in the consensus in a second-hand manner from the institutional authority of the IPCC and the emphatic nature in which the consensus is portrayed .\nThis \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Overconfident assertions by the \u2018 Big Player \u2019 take away the motivation for scientists to challenge the consensus , particularly when they can expect to be called a \u2018 denier \u2019 for their efforts and see their chances diminish for professional recognition and research funding .\nThe consensus building process acts to amplify personal biases , and marginalizes disagreement from either a majority opinion or the opinion of the loudest or most motivated person in the room .\nOne can only speculate on the magnitude and importance of the biases introduced into climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking process .", "author": "curryja", "url":

logical fallacies .\nPart II addressed biases associated with a consensus building process .\nPart II addresses the role of social conflicts and biases .\nAdditional biases are triggered by social conflict between an individual \u2019 s responsibility for responsible conduct of research , and the larger ethical issues associated with the well-being of the public and the environment .\nFurther , social biases are triggered by careerist goals , loyalty to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scientists have the responsibility of adhering to the principles of ethical research and professional standards .\nBut what happens when other responsibilities get in the way of these professional standards ?\nThese might include responsibilities to their conscience , their colleagues , institutions , the public and/or the environment .\nOne can imagine many different conflicts across this range of responsibilities that that can bias the scientific process .\nAs an example , scientists that have been heavily involved with the IPCC may be concerned with preserving the importance of the IPCC and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their professional success , funding and influence .\nArguably the most important of these are conflicts between the responsible conduct of research and larger ethical issues associated with the well-being of the public and the environment .\nFuller and Mosher \u2019 s book Climategate : The CruTape Letters argued that \u2018 noble cause corruption \u2019 was a primary motivation behind the Climategate deceits .\nNoble cause corruption is when the ends of protecting the climate ( noble ) justify the means of sabotaging your scientific opponents ( ignoble ) .\nPsychologist Brian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the most common and problematic bias in science is \u2018 motivated reasoning \u2019 .\nPeople that have a \u2018 dog in the fight \u2019 ( reputational , financial , ideological , political ) interpret observations to fit a particular idea that supports their particular \u2018 dog.\n\u2019 The term \u2018 motivated reasoning \u2019 is usually reserved for political motivations , but preserving their reputation or funding is also a strong motivator among scientists .\nThe embedding of political values into science occurs when value statements or ideological claims are wrongly treated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of attitudes about the environment ; the problem occurs because there is the presumption that one set of attitudes is right and those who disagree are in denial .\nThis results in conversion of a widely shared political ideology about climate change into \u2018 reality.\n\u2019 Confirmation bias can become even stronger when people confront questions that trigger moral emotions and concerns about group identity .\nPeople \u2019 s beliefs become more extreme when they \u2019 re surrounded by like-minded colleagues .\nThey come to assume that their opinions are not only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what social psychologist Jonathan Haidt calls a \u2018 tribal-moral community \u2019 with its own sacred values about what \u2019 s worth studying and what \u2019 s taboo .\nSuch biases can lead to widely-accepted claims that reflect the scientific community \u2019 s blind spots more than they reflect justified scientific conclusions .\nPsychologists Cusiman and Lombrozo found that people facing a dilemma between believing an impartial assessment of the evidence and believing what would better fulfill a moral obligation , people often believe in line with the latter .\nCuisman and Lombrozo found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than morally bad beliefs .\nThey also found that

"content": "Mentorships by professors of students are among the vital functions of a university .\nHere I expose the vulnerable underbelly of mentorship and one possible threat to academic freedom and scholarship .\nA tiny percentage of students will go on to an academic career .\nThese are the keeners , and they often develop significant bonds with one or more of their supervisors .\nAt their best , these relationships model the collegiality conducive to a fertile scholarly community .\nAt their worst , they undermine scholarship .\nI confine my examples to philosophy , but I suspect they generalize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports teams , academic disciplines have their stars , those who have not only made important contributions to their disciplines but have also become icons for non-intellectual aspects of their characters .\nWittgenstein is known as much for claiming he had solved all of philosophy \u2019 s problems in the Tractatus than for the Tractatusitself .\nAnd I suspect far more have heard of the former than have read the latter .\nDavid Lewis was so excruciatingly shy that one could walk twenty paces before he \u2019 d return a hello .\nSaul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conferences so she could cook him Kosher meals .\nHannah Arendt had an affair with Martin Heidegger .\nAnd so on .\nA group of philosophy majors , otherwise known as Phil-nerds , are as liable to share trivia about philosophers over coffee and smokes [ sic ] than they are to talk philosophy .\nOne discussion with my Phil-nerd cohort was about what ought to be the collective noun for Phil-nerds e.g.\n, a disputation .\nIn true philosophical fashion , we never reached an agreement .\nSome professors might blush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a common subject of Phil-nerd klatches .\nDr. P messes his hair like his idol , Einstein .\nDr. B never says hello or makes eye contact when he walks into the classroom .\nBoth turn even the most unrelated topic into a rant about global warming deniers .\nDr. A walks like a vampire .\nDr. R lets a little spittle fly when he talks about religion .\nBy and large , these observations betoken endearment , and are often coupled with intellectual admiration .\nAccordingly , many students will want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleague of mine who explicitly sought to emulate one Dr. B referred to himself as Mini-B .\nAs the proverb goes , imitation is the sincerest form of flattery .\nAnd most often , imitation of this kind is harmless .\nBut there \u2019 s an autonomous worry , a worry about how this eagerness to please plays out in an academic environment , and about what is being imitated .\nSome students emulate not only their mentors \u2019 disciplinary interests but also their ideas and attitudes .\nMore particularly their advocacy commitments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAs Daniel Kahneman notes , \u201c For some of our most important beliefs we have no evidence at all , except that people we love and trust hold these beliefs \u201d ( Thinking , Fast and Slow , New York : Farrar , Straus and Giroux , 2011 , p. 209 ) .\nDavid Hume also describes this phenomenon in a Treatise on Human Nature : \u201c From these dispositions in philosophers and their disciples arises that mutual complaisance betwixt them ; while the former furnish such plenty of strange and unaccountable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe them \u201d ( London : Penguin Books , 1963 , p.75 ) .\nBeliefs acquired in this manner are very hard to self-scrutinize because no one wants to appear to be believing something just because someone she admires does , especially in philosophy .\nBut , as Hume notes : \u201c These sentiments [ founded in \u2026 the human mind ] , are not to be controlled or altered by any philosophical theory or speculation whatever\u2026 .\nNature will always maintain her rights , and prevail in the end over any abstract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Human Understanding , ed .\nEric Steinberg , Indianapolis : Hackett Publishing Company , 1977 , p. 68 ) .\nThere are reasons we reason in groups , but members of these groups have to be allowed to serve as correctives to one another .\nAn impossible task when group-think demands orthodoxy .\nThrough all of my undergrad and grad years , I had the good fortune of being a member of a gifted cohort .\nMy colleagues are talented , intelligent , and high-achievers .\nMost are carrying on toward doctorates in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard the following : \u201c I want to do my masters on Dr. S \u2019 s research for his sake .\nIt \u2019 s my gift to him , he deserves to have his work carried on.\n\u201d And , \u201c Dr .\nB is so smart , he just opens his mouth and everything that comes out is just wow .\nI have no idea what he \u2019 s saying , but he \u2019 s so smart .\nI could listen to him all day.\n\u201d Both raise red flags .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ into uncritical devotion .\nIn the first case , the student possibly stymies her own philosophical development for the sake of some imagined debt .\nIn the second , she does so by not asking Dr. B to make his sentences intelligible .\nI grant that no matter her reasons for pursuing Dr. S \u2019 s research , she might learn a ton .\nAnd Dr. B might just be as brilliant as the phonemes emanating from his mouth would seem .\nI \u2019 m not troubled by these examples .\nI \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might bring to these interactions , namely obtuseness and advocacy .\nObtuseness .\nMany professors get buried under their workload and complain to their students about it .\nEspecially to students they have taken under their wings as thesis supervisors .\nProfessors are willing but seldom compensated for taking on these extra duties .\nAnd supervising students who are high maintenance , ungrateful , or even abusive discourages this willingness .\nBut the diligent student who feels the professor is making sacrifices for her might develop a disproportionate sense of debt .\nA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he or she has a biddable student , a big relief for a busy person .\nRemember that my worry is about the uncritically devoted student coupled with a professor \u2019 s obtuseness .\nNothing here implies that either professor or student is disingenuous or compromising academic integrity .\nBut now let \u2019 s add my second cautionary note .\nAdvocacy .\nJust as the busy professor complains about workload , the same professor , devoted to a cause , is unlikely to keep it under wraps .\nHence students know the beliefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about .\nGlobal warming , a political affiliation , capitalism , feminism , and so on .\nIf this be doubted , just read some random evaluations on Rate My Professors.com .\nThe worry here is that the professor \u2019 s beliefs and attitudes imitated by an admiring student are not well-evaluated by the professor herself .\nThis is because one \u2019 s advocacy commitments more often than not fall outside one \u2019 s domain of expertise .\nSo , if the student is biddable and the professor obtuse , academic integrity is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they are not pushed at all .\nIt is a feature of the human brain that we are less likely to scrutinize beliefs we already hold , and more likely to scrutinize those we disagree with , particularly if we find those beliefs morally reprehensible .\nSo here arise two further worries .\nThe dissenting student who writes a paper criticizing any of her professor \u2019 s advocacy beliefs is more likely to be penalized than her biddable peers .\nWhat \u2019 s more , a once biddable student who suddenly dissents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s words , wake [ her professor ] out of [ his ] dogmatic slumber .\nAnd unlike correcting a spelling error or the solution to a logic problem that \u2019 s niggled him for years , he will not say thank you .\nAs in my experience , the student might get yelled at .\nI had a supervisor rabidly committed to anthropogenic global warming ( AGW ) .\nI am interested in belief-acquisition .\nThe intersection of these two projects might indicate trouble ahead .\nI simply wanted to complete my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked this professor to supervise an independent study on epistemic authority .\nHe agreed , and then proceeded to pen in the words \u201c and denialism \u201d .\n\u201c A special interest of mine , \u201d he told me .\nHere \u2019 s an abridged version .\nI noticed my professor used a very narrow definition of denialism and applied it to all kinds of cases where it did not fit .\nMy first move was to write as if I did not notice .\nI should mention that I am married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fire .\nDo your ontology , he said .\nWhen I told him my fears , he was angry .\nJust do your job .\nAnd he scolded me for thinking his colleague would be anything but professional .\nI usually love to crow I was right and you were wrong , but not in this case .\nI concluded that the word \u201c denialism \u201d was a rhetorical flourish often deployed as an ad hominem .\nAnd I warned that its use in the already vitriolic AGW debate was liable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cooperation required for our epistemic practices .\nDeployed over time in an already polarized environment , it might even contribute to the undermining of social flourishing .\nI hope you notice the word might because he did not ; he read will cause .\nNote as well that I neither asserted nor denied any of the propositions on which the AGW consensus rests .\nThat was not my project .\nBut by not ratifying any of these assertions he assumed I was on the other side of his commitments , and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s comments , \u201c No one is in a position to tell those involved in this ( AGW ) dispute to settle down and play nice.\n\u201d I thought , you put me in this position when you added the words \u201c and denialism \u201d .\nThis brings me to my other worry , arising from another position I found myself in .\nThat of my relationship with my student colleagues and their respective relationships with my supervisor .\nOne or two were also under his supervision .\nIt is remarkable that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis of the term \u201c denialism , \u201d one piped up that he would never challenge my supervisor on denialism .\nI was not concocting my worries , we all knew .\nAnyone who walked by his bulletin board knew .\nBut .\nMy colleagues admire my supervisor , and rightly so .\nThey have enjoyed good working relationships , even friendship .\nWhile I could have pressed a grievance , doing so might have damaged both my relationship with my peers and their respective relationships with my supervisor .\nIf I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeed .\nAnd since they are significantly younger than I am , I wanted them to have the best experience possible .\nBut to be perfectly honest , I am not that altruistic .\nI feared for me .\nMy situation went from bad to worse , and I chose to walk away .\nI still grieve my loss , and even still the wound is tender .\nI feel it every time I celebrate my friends \u2019 achievements .\nWorse , I always struggle with whether by walking away I preserved my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I damaged that integrity by walking away .\nI leave these worries with you .\nBut I also leave you with a little advice .\nIf you are a professor , there is no fault in having advocacy commitments .\nBut if you are evaluating a student \u2019 s work on whether she upholds these commitments rather than on academic criteria , be explicit .\nA student should always know which hat you are wearing .\nYou should also be cognizant that if a paper challenges your Precious , you are very likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That \u2019 s just what it is to have a Precious !\nThere is no shame in asking for an independent marker .\nIn fact , this is a hallmark of your academic integrity .\nIf you \u2019 re a student planning an academic career , reread my article .\nYour professors are your future peers , and you , too , will one day supervise students .\nPamela Lindsay ( ) writes philosophy and social and political commentary , accompanied

of societal problems ?\nSome excerpts from the Time Magazine article : From her perch in the West Wing , McCarthy has been charged by Biden with overseeing a dramatic shift in the way the U.S. pursues action on climate change .\nInstead of turning to a select few environment-\u00adfocused agencies to make climate policy , McCarthy and her office are working to infuse climate considerations into everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she runs includes everyone from the Secretary of Defense , who is evaluating the climate threat to national security , to the Treasury Secretary , who is working to stem the risk that climate change poses to the financial system .\nFor decades , the idea that climate change touches everything has grown behind the scenes .\nLeaders from small island countries have pleaded with the rest of the world to notice how climate change has begun to uproot their lives , in areas from health care to schooling .\nSocial scientists have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change will ripple across society , contributing to a surge in migration , reduced productivity and a spike in crime .\nAnd advocates and thinkers have proposed everything from a conscious move to economic degrowth to eco-capitalism to make climate the government \u2019 s driving force .\nNow , spurred by alarming science , growing public fury and a deadly pandemic , government officials , corporate bosses and civil-society leaders are finally waking up to a simple idea whose time has come : climate is everything .\nIt \u2019 s out of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of billions of euros to put climate at the center of its economic plans , seemingly unrelated activist groups have embraced environmental goals , and investors have flooded firms advancing the energy transition with trillions of dollars .\n\u201c The world is crossing the long-awaited political tipping point on climate right now , \u201d says Al Gore , a former U.S. Vice President who won the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize for his climate activism .\n\u201c We are seeing the beginning of a new era.\n\u201d The course of climatization\u2014the process by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the coming years in every corner of society .\nWhether it leads to a more resilient world or exacerbates the worst elements of our society depends on whether we adjust or just stumble through .\n\u201c We are at the point where climate change means systems change\u2014and almost every system will change , \u201d says Rachel Kyte , dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University and a longtime climate leader .\n\u201c That understanding is long overdue , but I don \u2019 t think we know exactly what it means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of maximum hope ; it \u2019 s also a moment of high risk.\n\u201d A changing climate has been the norm throughout the Earth \u2019 s 4.6 billion year history .\nThe Earth \u2019 s temperature and weather patterns change naturally over time scales ranging from decades to millions of years .\nNatural variations in climate originate in two ways .\nInternal climate fluctuations exchange energy , water and carbon between the atmosphere , oceans , land and ice , which changes the surface climate .\nExternal influences on the climate system include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun and the effects of volcanic eruptions .\nHuman activities also influence climate by changing atmospheric concentrations of CO and other greenhouse gases , altering the concentrations of aerosol particles in the atmosphere , and through land use and changing land cover .\nOver the past several decades , the definition of \u2018 climate change \u2019 has shifted away from the broader geological interpretation .\nArticle 1 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) defines \u2018 climate change \u2019 as : \u201c a change of climate which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods.\n\u201d The UNFCCC thus makes a distinction between climate change attributable to human activities altering the atmospheric composition , versus climate variability attributable to natural causes .\nThis redefinition of \u2018 climate change \u2019 to refer only to manmade climate change has effectively eliminated natural climate change from the public discussion on climate change .\nAny change that is observed over the past century , on whatever time scale , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumption leads to connecting every unusual weather or climate event to manmade climate change from fossil fuel emissions .\nThe UNFCCC definition of \u2018 climate change \u2019 engenders two logical fallacies .\nThe fallacy of the single cause occurs when it is assumed that there is a single , simple cause of an outcome , when in reality it may have been caused by a number of jointly sufficient causes .\nClimate variability and change are influenced both by natural climate processes and human activity .\nA jingle fallacy is based on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the same name capture the same construct .\n\u2018 Climate change \u2019 under the UNFCCC definition is a much narrower construct than climate change in the geological sense .\nUse of the term becomes a jingle fallacy when it is inferred that all climate change \u2013 recent and future \u2013 is manmade .\nThe ubiquitous jingle fallacy surrounding the UNFCC definition of climate change introduces a framing bias .\nFramesact as organizing principles that shape how people conceptualize an issue .\nFrames can direct how a problem is stated , what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relevant , and what answers might be appropriate .\nA framing bias occurs when a narrow approach is employed that pre-ordains the conclusion to a much more complex problem .\nThe narrow framing of climate change as manmade global warming has marginalized natural climate variability .\nThis narrow framing also dominates our understanding of the relationships of humans and society with climate .\nAn assumption is made that future climate change is controlled by the amount of manmade greenhouse gas emissions .\nRegional causes of climate variability , their impacts and their local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the causes of climate change and its solution are irreducibly global .\nThe term \u2018 climate change \u2019 doesn \u2019 t just connote the science of manmade global warming , but also an entire worldview of society .\nHulme ( 2010 ) identifies the fallacy of climate reductionism , a form of analysis and prediction in which the interdependencies that shape human life within the physical world are correlated with climate change .\nManmade climate change is then elevated to the role of the dominant predictor of societal change .\nMultiple possibilities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate predictions assert their influence over food production , health , tourism and recreation , human migration , violent conflict , etc .\nOther environmental , economic and social factors that influence these societal problems become marginalized .\nAn availability cascade is a self-reinforcing process of collective belief formation that triggers a self-perpetuating chain reaction : the more attention a danger gets , the more worried people become , leading to more news coverage and greater alarm .\nBecause slowly increasing temperatures do not seem alarming , \u2018 availability entrepreneurs \u2019 push extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human migration , etc .\nas being caused by manmade global warming \u2013 more of which is in store if we don \u2019 t quickly act to reduce fossil fuel emissions .\nThe ever-expanding narrative of climate change entrains a range of social values into the proposed solutions .\nThe momentum of the climate change narrative leads to claims that there is a solution to many other societal problems within the climate change cause \u2013 an example is social justice in the context of the U.S. Green New Deal .\nThis link acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the climate change narrative to blame or attack those opposed to the separate cause .\nClimate change has thus become a grand narrative in which human-caused climate change has become a dominant cause of societal problems .\nEverything that goes wrong then reinforces the conviction that that there is only one thing we can do prevent societal problems \u2013 stop burning fossil fuels .\nThis grand narrative misleads us to think that if we solve the problem of manmade climate change , then these other problems would also be solved .\nThis belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the true causes of these problems .\nThe end result is narrowing of the viewpoints and policy options that we are willing to consider in dealing with complex issues such as public health , weather disasters and national security .\nAnd so , climate becomes everything .", "author": "curryja", "url": "https://judithcurry.com/2021/05/02/climate-is-everything/", "published": "Mon, 03 May 2021 00:26:24 +0000", "published_utc": 1620015984,

shelf", "content": "Reviews of new books by Steve Koonin , Matthew Kahn and Marc Morano .\nEarlier this year , two notable climate books were published [ reviews ] : \u2022 How to avoid a climate disaster , by Bill Gates \u2022 The new climate war : the fight to take back our planet , by Michael Mann The Mann and Gates books both assume climate disaster .\nApart from this assumption , Bill Gate \u2019 s book is rather interesting and describes technological solutions .\nMann \u2019 s new book is mostly indistinguishable from his earlier books , distinguished mainly by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( including Bill Gates ) .\nThe three books that are the focus of this post provide different perspectives on climate change : \u2022 Unsettled : What climate science tells us , what it doesn \u2019 t and why it matters by Steve Koonin \u2022 Adapting to climate change : Markets and management of an uncertain future , by Matthew Kahn \u2022 Green fraud : Why the Green New Deal is worse than you think , by Marc Morano Unsettled : What climate science science tells us , what it doesn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had a unique personal trajectory through the climate/energy space over the past 15 years .\nI entered into this trajectory [ link ] in 2014 in context of the American Physical Society Workshop ( which Koonin chaired ) .\nIn this book , Koonin comes across as very honest and trustworthy , and genuinely concerned about the integrity of climate science and the research process .\nA welcome contrast to the way Michael Mann comes across .\nA review by Forbes provides a good summary of Koonin \u2019 s book , excerpts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against current climate science but that what the media and politicians and activists say about climate science has drifted so far out of touch with the actual science as to be absurdly , demonstrably false \u201d .\nOne of the key contributions of Koonin \u2019 s book is its detailed account of how the climate change message gets distorted as it goes through successive filters as the research literature gets converted to assessment reports and report summaries which are then subject to alarmist and apocalyptic media coverage and politicians \u2019 soundbites .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why \u201d , Koonin argues that misinformation in the service of persuasion is not at the behest of \u201c some secret cabal but rather a self-reinforcing alignment of perspectives and interests \u201d .\nOf the media , Koonin observes that if reporters don \u2019 t have a narrative of gloom , they won \u2019 t have a story that makes it into the papers since \u201c if it bleeds , it leads \u201d .\nScientific institutions seem \u201c overwilling to persuade rather than inform \u201d , and the entire raison d \u2019 etre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the \u201c climate crisis \u201d .\nThe reviewers on Amazon are genuinely appreciative of Koonin \u2019 s book .\nHowever , the book has received several adverse reviews : InsideClimateNews and ClimateFeedback attempt to knock back Koonin \u2019 s statements and interpretations about historical climate change .\nThey don \u2019 t directly critique Koonin \u2019 s statements , but make alternative statements ( e.g .\nwith a cherry picked date ) that they claim refutes Koonin \u2019 s statements .\nIn any event , all of Koonin \u2019 s statements are consistent with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for low/med confidence .\nAlthough I do agree that given this book is titled Unsettled and is about uncertainty , some of Koonin \u2019 s scientific assertions are not accompanied by the appropriate documentation or a sense of the uncertainty and scope for disagreement .\nThe reviews mainly address Part I of Koonin \u2019 s book ( the science ) .\nPart II is our response .\nKoonin divides our response into 3 chapters .\nThe first is \u201c what we won \u2019 t do \u201d : rapid CO2 mitigation .\nIMO this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where Koonin lays out the impediments to global ( or even US ) carbon neutrality on the timescales of decades .\n\u201c What we might do \u201d is geoengineering ; \u201c what we will do \u201d is adaptation .\nAnd the final chapter lays out what Koonin thinks we should do ( after keeping the earlier part of the book free from his own evaluation of \u2018 should \u2019 ) : better observations of the climate system , improve understanding of what climate models can tell us , sloooow energy transition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When someone asks me for a good primer on climate science and the associated debate , I have been recommending What We Know About Climate Change by Kerry Emanuel and Lukewarming by Pat Michaels .\nBoth of these books are easy to understand , and the combination spans the range of credible perspectives .\nI can comfortably add Koonin \u2019 s book to this list ; his selection of science topics are good ones , and the book is very well written with clear explanations , interesting anecdotes and useful analogies .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Considering how Koonin \u2019 s book might influence policy or change the way we think about climate science or our response to climate change , I would say not much .\nOther important issues that Kooning raises such as politicization of the science , climate communications , and our policy responses are based on personal experiences and reflections , with little evidence of having explored the broad literature on these topics .\nKoonin reiterates his push for a climate \u2018 red team \u2019 ; personally I think that the climate science enterprise is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in context of a government led or sanctioned effort .\nAdapting to climate change : Markets and management of an uncertain future Matthew Kahn is a distinguished environmental economist , who I have come to know via twitter and some email exchanges .\nMuch of his work relates to adaptation .\nHis perspective is summarized in a 2016 essay Climatopolis Revisited : Many environmentalists view people as passive victims in the face of climate change , but I reject this view .\nForward-looking , risk-averse economic actors have strong incentives to take protective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of climate shocks .\nThe only decision makers who will not take protective actions against changing circumstances are those who \u201c do not know that they do not know.\n\u201d But when it comes to \u201c known unknowns , \u201d as Donald Rumsfeld famously described them , economic actors who know that they do not know what climate change will do to assets such as coastal real estate have strong incentives to take defensive actions .\nIn this age of smartphones and easy access to information , who can claim that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If such \u201c climate skeptics \u201d truly do reject the stream of news , then a new market for trusted information providers will emerge .\nThe blurb for his new book states : It is all but certain that the next century will be hotter than any we \u2019 ve experienced before .\nEven if we get serious about fighting climate change , it \u2019 s clear that we will need to adapt to the changes already underway in our environment .\nThis book considers how individual economic choices in response to climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Using the tools of microeconomics , Matthew E. Kahn explores how decisions about where we live , how our food is grown , and where new business ventures choose to locate are affected by climate change .\nKahn suggests new ways that big data can be deployed to ease energy or water shortages to aid agricultural operations and proposes informed policy changes related to public infrastructure , disaster relief , and real estate to nudge land use , transportation options , and business development in the right direction .\nFrom a brief review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on how climate change and extreme weather events affect key sectors of the economy .\nAlthough he does not dismiss the need to curb rising temperatures , he suggests that American society is getting better at adapting to climate change .\nWeather shocks provide incentives for businesses to develop new products , such as resilient building materials and in-home battery backup systems .\nBig data allows utility providers to adjust electricity and water prices in response to weather events , encouraging consumers to modify their usage in environmentally friendly ways .\nTo be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to markets to respond to climate change .\nKahn highlights the need for investments in public infrastructure to help with climate change adaptation and for reforms of urban planning rules and flood insurance laws .\nStill , his book shows that one need not be a climate change skeptic to be a climate change optimist .\nHere is the table of contents for the book : Nearly everyone at least mentions adaptation as a climate solution ( including Koonin ) , but without any concrete suggestions or insights as to why/how this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t alot of books on climate adaptation ; much of this is new material for me .\nWhile reading Kahn \u2019 s book , I was struck with new insights on almost each page .\nThis is a book that I know I will frequently return to as I ponder how we can respond to climate change .\nGreen fraud : Why the Green New Deal is worse than you think Morano \u2019 s book is clearly pitched at Trump \u2019 s base .\nThe book opens with endorsement statements from Hannity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishes Morano \u2019 s bona fides as the biggest , baddest climate skeptic of them all .\nHowever , if you can get past the first 26 pages , this book provides a very cogent analysis of U.S. climate politics .\nAt the end of Chapter 1 , Morano provides a summary of the forthcoming chapters ; I \u2019 ve rather clumsily taken screen shots of this text .\nThe book does not \u2018 deny \u2019 the basic science of climate change , but challenges whether it is \u2018 dangerous \u2019 ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe book is not about the science , but rather our political response and the failure of the \u2018 solutions.\n\u2019 .\nThe book includes carefully crafted arguments , spiced with many amusing anecdotes .\nThe book has almost 90 pages of endnotes and references .\nAs far as I can tell , Green Fraud has not been reviewed by any mainstream outlet .\nThe response from the climatariat has been attempts to get the book \u2018 cancelled \u2019 .\nFrom the Daily Kos : Anyone who wants to understand the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this book .\nClimate activists should read this book to understand what they are up against ( and also some of the foolishness in the name of climate activism ) .\nI would love to see a real attempt at critiquing this book ( rather than attempts to cancel it or smear Morano ) .\nI really appreciate reading single-authored books on climate change that lay out a vision of the \u2018 whole thing \u2019 .\nThe long form allows for synthesis and extended arguments and single logic , and the single author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole thing .\nAs you can see , there are many different perspectives and ways of framing the climate problem and its solutions .\nWith regards to \u2018 The Science , \u2019 there is nothing in Koonin \u2019 s or Morano \u2019 s book that isn \u2019 t within the likely/very likely range of the IPCC for a low/medium confidence finding .\nKoonin gets it mostly right by focusing on historical observations and acknowledging that much is \u2018 unsettled.\n\u2019 We need to get past fighting the climate policy wars through \u2018 The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly with regards to future projections .\nThe bigger issue is whether climate change is \u2018 dangerous.\n\u2019 Lomborg \u2019 s and Schellenberger \u2019 s books focus on this topic , and it also appears in Koonin \u2019 s and Morano \u2019 s books .\nIf climate change is perceived to be locally dangerous , then local adaptation ( per Kahn ) is the way to go .\nThe science/policy interface is dealt with explicitly by Mann , Koonin and Morano .\nKoonin touches on some of the key issues regarding the disfunction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mitigation .\nMorano argues that it isn \u2019 t necessary , Lomborg and Koonin argue that it is ineffective at influencing the climate , and Schellenberger and Gates argue for better technologies ( with Schellenberger focused on nuclear ) .\nWhile covering similar territory ( climate politics ) , Morano \u2019 s book is the polar opposite of Mann \u2019 s book in terms of perspective and who are the villains .\nBoth books are somewhat polemical , but present two very different political world views .\nA wicked problem is characterized by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragmentation , interest differentiation and a dysfunction distribution of power among stakeholders .\nThese different perspectives clearly reflect the wickedness of the climate change problem .\nThe most useful way to grapple with this wickedness is to understand multiple perspectives on the problem .\nThis involves individuals reading both Mann \u2019 s and Morano \u2019 s books , and not attempting to cancel the books that don \u2019 t align with your own perspective .\nAnd finally , Amazon \u2019 s sales rankings in Environment Policy ( as of 5/9 )", "author": "curryja", "url":

Meridional Overturning Circulation ( AMOC ) , also known as the Gulf Stream System , has been as weak as in the last decades \u201c .\nThis announcement from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research was headlined recently in my morning newspaper in France ( and in dozens of others elsewhere ) as being the result of the anthropogenic \u2018 rechauffment climatique.\n\u2019 We were warned that the consequences would include more rigorous winters for us over here in Europe .\n[ 1 ] Whoever wrote that can not have critically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gulf Stream that brings Western Europe a comfortable maritime climate , because folklore it turns out to be\u2026 Rahmstorf and his colleagues in Potsdam have hammered away at this issue for a long time now .\n[ 2 ] Their new paper is brief , presenting bundles of proxies intended to demonstrate that flow of the Gulf Stream has weakened in recent decades , and so put the equable maritime climate of Europe at risk .\nBut this a misleading oversimplification : in reality , the Gulf Stream is no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gyre of the North Atlantic and , as Wyville-Thompson wrote in 1871 concerning the Gulf Stream \u201c after leaving the Strait of Florida\u2026at about 42oN a large portion\u2026turns eastward and southward and , eddying around the Sargasso Sea , fuses with the northern edge of the equatorial current and rejoins the main circulation.\n\u201d [ 3 ] So the North Atlantic Current which continues towards Europe and eventually enters the Arctic Ocean carries just a very small fraction of the water that had previously passed along the Florida coast as the Gulf Stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received from the seas around Newfoundland and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence .\nLong-term change in SST is difficult to quantify , but the evolution of sea surface temperature indicated by the HadNMAT2 archive for the northern oceans is shown below .\n[ 4 ] Although the authors of this study suggest that these data support \u201c existing estimates of global warming \u201d it is difficult to imagine that they contain a progressive anthropogenic signal : the data are dominated ( i ) by the consequences of the numbers of ships at sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early bucket-over-the-side observations and ( iii ) by the advent of automated free-drifting instrumentation .\nThese observations do not support the progression of the North Atlantic temperature/circulation indices that were offered by Potsdam to support their proposal for an exceptional slowdown in North Atlantic circulation during approximately the same period .\n[ 5 ] And the pattern of SST changes on much smaller scale obtained by coastal sampling at lighthouses , tide gauge sites , and so on suggests that southeast coast of the US washed by the Gulf Stream has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here are the data for three regions of the western Atlantic .\n[ 6 ] They do not support the trends indicated by Potsdam \u2019 s proxies over the last 150 years .\nSuch statements require evidence \u2013 in this case , not hard to find : the consequences of progressive adjusting , cleaning and homogenising of the original observations that previously had been shown as individually-coloured data plots at NASA Goddard were recently edited on their public website so that it became difficult to visualise any but the final homogenised data .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done the job by hand , and sloppily .\nSo I was able to find \u2013 and recover \u2013 their original plots for two stations very relevant to this discussion : Valentia Observatory on the shore of Galway and Vestmannaeyjar on an island south of Iceland .\nIn each , the darker lines of the earlier year of the homogenised data have been shifted very significantly down to introduce significant warming where there was none in the lighter lines representing the unadjusted data .\nNOAA performs only a very modest adjustment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final decade to produce their GHCN-M ( adjusted ) archive .\nThe pattern of the Galway data , having warmer periods around 1940 and also at the end of the century is repeated at rural stations in Western Europe ; it also perfectly reflects the changing value of the NAO and the evolution of the atmospheric pressure field over the northeast Atlantic .\nBut warnings such as those from Potsdam have had a long history , despite rebuttal : the supposed effects on climate , especially of Europe , of a slowdown of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nature in 2005 just prior to a post-Kyoto climate meeting , in relation to observations of deep flow at lower latitudes .\n[ 8 ] This notion was rapidly challenged by a comment from Carl Wunsch entitled \u2018 The Atlantic Conveyor may have slowed , but don \u2019 t panic yet !\n\u2019 And it is not surprising that he should have reacted so dogmatically as he did : \u2018 European readers should be reassured that the Gulf Stream \u2019 s existence is a consequence of the large-scale wind system over the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fluid motion on a rotating planet .\nThe only way to produce an ocean circulation without a Gulf Stream is either to turn off the wind system , or to stop the Earth \u2019 s rotation , or both.\n\u2019 [ 9 ] Wunsch might well also have commented that the strongest heat flux from the Gulf Stream to the atmosphere occurs in the western ocean to the south of Nova Scotia , where sun-warmed water from low latitudes encounters very cold polar air .\nThis process is dominated by latent heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global scale \u2013 but along the coasts of western Europe there is little or no heat remaining in he ocean to transfer to the atmosphere .\n[ 10 ] Consequently , it is clear that the popular image of a broad Gulf Stream sweeping eastwards across the Atlantic Ocean at about 45oN , bearing heat gained in the tropics to maintain Europe \u2019 s maritime climate , is unhelpful .\nThe fact is that everybody seems to have been forgotten that a perfectly good maritime climate exists at similar latitudes on the Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no equivalent of the Gulf Stream : in fact , the cold water mass lying along this coast at about the same latitude as Europe , originates in the Gulf of Alaska and brings no warmth with it .\nBut winters are warm and summers cool here , as Richard Seager , an apparently naive English oceanographer , discovered to his surprise when he first visited the US West coast .\nThis maritime climate lacking a Gulf Stream analogue is the consequence of heat carried by south-westerly winds from the distant subtropical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ 11 ] The warmth that these winds bring is not lost to the ocean in passing across the cold Alaskan coastal water , because sensible heat flux between ocean and atmosphere is almost everywhere a loss term .\nThis is due to the micro-structure of the oceanic skin layer across which molecular diffusion dominates ; only in high latitude autumn and winter , when strong wind-stress creates breaking waves which disrupt the molecular skin-layer , is there any significant flux of sensible heat from ocean to atmosphere .\n[ 12 ] When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rocky Mountains , their gyral structure is vertically compressed , expanding horizontally to preserve angular momentum .\nThis forces the storm tracks to curve southwards across the continent so that they encounter the ocean again at a significantly lower latitude \u2013 in the northern Caribbean and east of Florida , where sensible heat is transferred to the chilly atmosphere very rapidly .\nThen , during its north-easterly movement across the Atlantic towards Europe , the surface air mass picks up further heat from the surface of the ocean by sensible heat flux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significantly exceeds that carried in the ocean .\n[ 13 ] If these winds crossed the ocean to Europe at the same latitude as they encountered the western Rocky mountains , their consequence for European climate would be much less positive .\nThese images from Ventusky simulations for ( left ) air temperature close to the surface on 30 November 2011 and ( right ) for 31 July 2020. are chosen to show the classical softening of the western European winter climate by warm south-westerly winds ( left ) and also a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in relation to European climate , concerning our very uncomfortable southern neighbours , North Africa and the Sahara desert .\nSuch conditions can develop also in winter as they did on 6 February this year when my car , and all the others in town , was speckled with raisin-sized blobs of damp Saharan mud aggregated from dust particles carried in ( and fallen from ) a low cumulus deck .\n[ 14 ] So the myth of the maritime , equable climate brought to Europe by the Gulf Stream really needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a myth .\nIt is perhaps appropriate to the British Isles and Scandinavia , but certainly not to the sub-continent as a whole .\nAnd , that \u201c Gulf Stream at its lowest in 1000 years \u201d of Potsdam that was trumpeted by a scare-hungry press is perhaps also mythical \u2013 but is certainly unhelpful in understanding how the real world actually works .\nBut I fear that we shall hear more , and probably much more , from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research as a result of their espousal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe \u2013 a concept that doesn \u2019 t bear close examination : they are , after all , funded to study the fields of \u201c global change , climate impacts , and sustainable development \u201d and I infer from their writings that this is not interpreted as a mandate to try to understand the natural world \u2013 and so sometimes , as in this present case , they get it wrong .\n[ 3 ] Nature ( 1871 ) vol .\n4 , 251-253 .\nImage from Tomczac and Godfrey \u2019 s indispensible

factor\u2212chronic disease research .\nThe study also looked at how government bureaucrats use these claims to skew policy in favor of PM regulation and their own positions .\nAll that we discuss below is drawn from our study .\nAmericans need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used at the EPA for setting policy and regulations are flawed and obviously expensive .\nViewers can download and read our study to decide the extent of the problem for themselves .\nUnbeknownst to the public and far too many academic scientists , modern science suffers from an irreproducibility crisis in a wide range of disciplines\u2014from medicine to social psychology .\nFar too frequently scientists are unable reproduce claims made in research .\nGiven the irreproducible science crisis , we completed a study for the National Association of Scholars ( NAS ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sands project .\nThe project\u2014Shifting Sands : Unsound Science and Unsafe Regulation\u2014examines how irreproducible science negatively affects select areas of government policy and regulation in different federal agencies .\nOur study investigated portions of research in the field of epidemiology used for US Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) regulation of PM .\nThis research claims that particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns ( PM ) in outdoor air is harmful to humans in many ways .\nBut is the research on PM and the claims made in the research misleading ?\nAcademic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive ( significant association ) claims\u2014but not reproducible research .\nThis encourages epidemiologists \u2013 who are mainly academics \u2013 to wittingly or negligently use various flawed statistical practices to produce positive , but ( we show ) likely false , claims .\nThere are numerous key biases that epidemiologists continue to unintentionally ( or intentionally ) ignore in studies of air quality and health effects .\nThis is done to make positive , but likely false , research claims .\nSome examples are : Our study focused on the multiple testing and multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of research has been affected by flawed statistical practices .\nWe subjected research claiming that PM is harmful to a series of simple but severe statistical tests .\nOur study found strong circumstantial evidence that claims made about PM causing mortality , heart attacks and asthma are compromised by flawed statistical practices .\nThese flawed practices make the research untrustworthy as it favors producing false claims that would not reproduce if done properly .\nThis is discussed further below .\nEstimating the number of statistical tests in a study \u2013 There is known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a range of statistical tests and use different statistical models on observational data sets .\nThe researchers then can select , use and report ( cherry pick ) a portion of the test and model results that favor a narrative .\nOne form of simple but severe testing we employed was counting .\nSpecifically , we estimated the number of statistical hypothesis tests conducted in 70 different published epidemiology studies that make PM \u2212health effect claims .\nThese results are presented in our study .\nThe counting procedures are straightforward , and readers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistical tests in published observational studies .\nIn our case , the median number of statistical tests performed in these 70 studies was over 13,000 .\nEpidemiologists typically use a Relative Risk ( RR ) or Odds Ratio ( OR ) lower confidence limit > 1 ( or a p-value < 0.05 ) as decision criteria to justify a significant PM \u2212health effect claim in a statistical test .\nHowever , for any given number of statistical tests performed on the same set of data set , 5 % are expected to yield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A study with 13,000 statistical tests could have as many as 0.05 x 13,000 = 650 significant , but false results !\nGiven advanced statistical software , epidemiologists today can easily perform this many or more statistical tests on a set of data in an observational study .\nThey can then cherry pick 10 or 20 of their most interesting findings and write up a nice , tight research paper around these findings\u2014which are most likely to be false , irreproducible findings .\nWe have yet to see an air quality\u2212health effects study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHow exactly is one supposed to tell the difference between a false positive or a possible true positive result when so many tests are performed and so few results are presented ?\nDiagnosing evidence of publication bias , p-hacking and/or HARKing \u2013 Publication bias is the failure to publish the results of a study unless they are positive results that show significant associations .\nP-hacking is reanalyzing data in many different ways to yield a target result .\nHARKing ( Hypothesizing After Results are Known ) is using the data to generate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated first .\nIt is traditional in epidemiology to use confidence intervals instead of p-values from a hypothesis test to demonstrate statistical significance .\nAs both confidence intervals and p-values are constructed from the same data , they are interchangeable , and one can be calculated from the other .\nWe first calculated p-values from confidence intervals for data from meta-analysis studies that make PM \u2212health effect claims .\nA meta-analysis is a systematic procedure for statistically combining data from multiple studies that address a common research question\u2014for example , whether PM is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect ( e.g.\n, mortality ) .\nWe looked at meta-analysis studies claiming that PM causes : i ) mortality , ii ) heart attacks and iii ) asthma .\nWe then used a simple but novel statistical method\u2014p-value plotting\u2014as a severe test to diagnose evidence of publication bias , p-hacking and/or HARKing in this data .\nMore specifically , after calculating p-values from confidence intervals we then plotted the distribution of rank ordered p-values ( a p-value plot ) .\nConceptually , a p-value plot allows us to examine a specific premise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data combined from multiple observational studies in meta-analysis .\nWhat should a p-value plot of the data look like ?\n\u2022 a plot that forms an approximate 45-degree line provides evidence of randomness\u2014supporting the null hypothesis of no significant association between factor A & outcome B ( Figure 1 ) \u2022 a plot that forms approximately a line with slope < 1 , where most of the p-values are small ( less than 0.05 ) , provides evidence for a real effect\u2014supporting a statistically significant association between factor A & outcome B ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibits bilinearity\u2014that divides into two lines\u2014provides evidence of publication bias , p-hacking and/or HARKing ( Figure 3 ) Figure 1 .\nP-value plot of a meta-analysis of observational data sets analyzing associations between elderly long-term exercise training ( factor A ) and mortality & morbidity ( injury ) ( outcome B ) ; data points drawn from 40 observational studies .\nFigure 2 .\nP-value plot of a meta-analysis of observational data sets analyzing associations between smoking ( factor A ) and squamous cell carcinoma of the lungs ( outcome B ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFigure 3 .\nP-value plot of a meta-analysis of observational data sets analyzing associations between PM ( factor A ) and all\u2212cause mortality ( outcome B ) ; data points drawn from 29 observational studies .\nWe show over a dozen p-value plots in our study for meta-analysis data of associations between PM ( and other air quality components ) and mortality , heart attacks and asthma .\nAll these plots exhibit bilinearity !\nThis provides compelling circumstantial evidence that the literature on PM ( and other air quality components ) \u2014specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims\u2014has been affected by statistical practices that have rendered the underlying research untrustworthy .\nOur findings are consistent with the general claim that false-positive results from publication bias , p-hacking and/or HARKing are common features of the medical science literature today , including the broad range of risk factor\u2212chronic disease research .\nThe process is further derailed with government involvement .\nThe EPA have relied on statistical analyses to show significant PM \u2212health effect associations .\nEPA bureaucrats who fund this type of research depend on regulations to support their existence .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the past 40 years .\nHowever , the EPA appears to have acted selectively in its approach to the health effects of PM .\nThis has been done by paying more attention to research that supports regulation ( i.e.\n, shows significant PM \u2212health effect associations ) and ignoring or downplaying research that shows no significant PM \u2212health effect associations .\nThis latter research exists , it is simply ignored or downplayed by the bureaucrats !\nNor are the researchers finding negative results funded .\nIt is apparent to us that bureaucrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignore , flawed statistical practices and other biases identified above in PM \u2212health effects research .\nThey , along with environmental activists , continuously push for tighter air quality regulation based on flawed practices and false findings .\n5 .\nCan this mess be fixed ?\nEpidemiologists and government bureaucrats collectively skew results of medical science towards justifying regulation of PM , while almost always keeping their data sets private .\nFar too many of these types , and a distressingly large amount of the public , believe that academic ( university ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , as epidemiology evidence is largely based on university research , we should treat it with the same skepticism as we would industry research .\nMainstream media appear clueless and uninterested in glaring biases in epidemiology research that cause false findings\u2014flawed statistical practices , analysis manipulation , cherry picking results , selective reporting , broken peer review .\nEpidemiologists , and government bureaucrats who depend on their work to justify PM regulation , proceed with far too much self-confidence .\nThey have an insufficient sense of the need for awareness of just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in measuring uncertainty rather than establishing certainty .\nThis mess plagues government policy by providing a false level of certainty to a body of research that justifies PM regulation .\nIn our study we make several recommendations to the Biden administration for fixing this mess .\nHowever , we do not hold our breath that they will be considered .\nSome of these include : \u2022 the administration needs to support statistically sound and reproducible science \u2022 unsound statistical practices silently supported by the EPA need to stop \u2022 the building and analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2022 these data sets should be made available for public scrutiny Most importantly , Americans need to be aware that current statistical practices being used at

do the IEA emissions scenarios compare with those used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) in their projections of future climate change ?\nA brief description of the emissions scenarios used by the IPCC is provided here for reference .\nThe Representative Concentration Pathways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four climate scenarios for the end of the 21st century .\nThe RCPs were formulated for use in the 2014 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) Fifth Assessment Report and the CMIP5 climate model simulations , to reflect different potential climate outcomes \u2013 RCP2.6 , RCP4.5 , RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 .\nThe number ( e.g .\n8.5 ) reflects the additional radiative forcing ( in Watts per square meter ) in 2100 from greenhouse gas emissions and other factors , relative to pre-industrial times .\nTo date , radiative forcing relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square meter .\nFor the forthcoming IPCC Sixth Assessment Report ( AR6 ) and the CMIP6 climate model simulations , Shared Socioeconomic Pathways ( SSPs ) are formulated from five socio-economic and technological trajectories that reflect pathways that the world could follow in the 21st century .\nEach pathway has a baseline in which no climate policies are enacted after 2010 .\nAdditional SSP scenarios are linked to climate policies to generate different outcomes for the end of the 21st century .\nA subset of SSP scenarios has been selected for the IPCC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2.6 , 3.4 , 4.5 , 6.0 , 7.0 or 8.5 Watts per square meter in 2100 .\nWhile the SSP nomenclature is more recent , the scientific literature and journalists continue to mostly use the RCP nomenclature .\nIn comparing the IEA scenarios with the IPCC scenarios , we see that the value for 2020 is higher for the IPCC ( 38 \u2013 42 GtCO /yr ) than for the IEA ( 34 GtCO /yr , which is the best available estimate for 2020 ) .\nThe IPCC scenarios \u2013 both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the IEA projections for RCP8.5 , RCP7.0 , RCP6.0 and RCP4.5 .\nOut to 2050 , RCP6.0 and RCP4.5 show similar , nearly flat trends that are comparable to the IEA STEP scenario .\nThe most striking aspect of the comparison between the IPCC and IEA scenarios to 2050 is the strong divergence of RCP8.5 from the IEA scenario , with RCP8.5 emissions values more than twice as high as the IEA STEP scenario at 2050 .\nRCP8.5 was formulated to explore an extreme outcome that is judged by energy analysts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is commonly referred to as the \u2018 business as usual \u2019 scenario .\nReferring to RCP8.5 as \u2018 business as usual \u2019 implies that it is probable in the absence of stringent emissions mitigation .\nThe IPCC , the U.S. National Climate Assessment and a majority of published papers have centered their analyses on RCP8.5 as a reference scenario against which climate impacts and policies are evaluated .\nFurther , RCP8.5 is being used by the insurance sector for projecting climate change impacts and also by state and local governments for regional adaptation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there has been substantial debate over RCP8.5 \u2013 whether it is plausible or even possible , and whether it should be used for policy-making purposes .\nThe 8.5 scenarios can only emerge under a very narrow range of circumstances , comprising a severe course change from recent energy use .\nBoth the CMIP5 and CMIP6 8.5 scenarios have drawn criticism particularly regarding assumptions around future coal use , requiring 6.5 times more coal use in 2100 than today \u2013 an amount larger than some estimates of recoverable coal reserves .\nA recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 5 % chance of occurring among all of the possible no-policy baseline scenarios ; the likelihood of RCP8.5 becomes much lower when recent and future commitments for policy

understood carbon feedbacks ( such as methane emissions from thawing permafrost ) could lead to higher forcing levels .\nHowever , such speculative feedbacks are unlikely to arise from the relatively modest warming expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of uncertainty relates to emissions from land use change , which is estimated to account for 5-15 % of total emissions .\nBut even with these uncertainties ,

origins", "content": "The concerning saga of the creation , enforcement and collapse of a \u2018 consensus \u2019 on Covid-19 origins .\nThe Covid-19 virus first appeared in Wuhan , China , where there is a laboratory that conducts research on bat coronaviruses .\nHowever from the beginning , the possibility that this virus accidentally escaped from the lab was dismissed quite forcefully by prominent virologists .\nThe \u2018 consensus \u2019 that Covid-19 had an entirely natural origin was established by two op-eds in early 2020 \u2013 The Lancet in February and Nature Medicine in March .\nThe Lancet op-ed stated , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theories suggesting that Covid-19 does not have a natural origin.\n\u201d In May 2021 , science reporter Nicholas Wade published a lengthy article in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists stating that the Lancet letter had been organized and drafted by Peter Daszak , president of the EcoHealth Alliance of New York .\nDaszak \u2019 s organization funded coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology .\nIf the Covid-19 virus had escaped from research that he funded , Daszak would be potentially culpable .\nDaszak had corralled other scientists with similar professional interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that anyone who mentions the obvious possibility that the pandemic might have a connection to the research in the Wuhan Lab could only be doing so with bad intentions .\nThe enormous gap between the actual state of knowledge in early 2020 and the confidence displayed in the two op-eds should have been obvious to anyone in the field of virology , or for that matter anyone with critical faculties .\nThere were scientists from adjacent fields who said as much .\nHowever , the pronouncements in these op-eds effectively shut down inquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was highly successful in garnering media enforcement of public opinion .\nThe so-called \u2018 fact checkers \u2019 of PolitiFact used these op-eds to shut down any discussion of the lab leak hypothesis .\nArticles in the mainstream press repeatedly stated that a consensus of experts had ruled lab escape out of the question or extremely unlikely .\nInvocation of \u2018 conspiracy theory \u2019 has become a reflex for arresting criticism .\nAnalysis by Matthew Crawford shows how the political environment caused the magic words \u2018 conspiracy theory \u2019 to trigger a wider epistemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides the following political frame for these events .\nSince Donald Trump publicly floated the idea that Covid-19 may have had its origin in a Chinese lab , it became a point of conviction for all those who believe in science that such a hypothesis could only be a conspiracy theory , probably rooted in \u2018 Sinophobia \u2019 .\nThe \u2018 conspiracy theory \u2019 of the lab leak hypothesis has been juxtaposed with reporting on anti-Asian hate crimes , thereby subsuming an urgent scientific question to a Trump-era morality play .\nPublication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 triggered a cascade of defections .\nCrawford describes the defections as \u201c not simply from a consensus that no longer holds , but from a fake consensus that is no longer enforceable.\n\u201d On 14 May , 18 scientists signed a letter in the journal Science with the title \u201c Investigate the origins of COVID-19 \u201d .\nIn an interview with the New York Times , an organizer of the letter stated , \u201c Anybody who \u2019 s making statements with a high level of certainty about this is just outstripping what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available evidence.\n\u201d Politifact has just withdrawn its Wuhan-Lab theory \u2018 fact check.\n\u2019 [ link ] What is concerning about this episode is not so much that a consensus has been overturned , but that a fake consensus was so easily enforced for year .\nThis occurred during a key period when understanding the origins of the virus had implications for how it could best be fought .\nScientists who understood that there was a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the origins of the virus did not speak up .\nProbity came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field of virology .\nMatthew Crawford states , \u201d Regardless of how the question of the virus \u2019 s origins is ultimately decided , we need to understand how the political drama surrounding the science played out if we are to learn anything from this pandemic and reduce the likelihood of future ones.\n\u201d Crawford argues that the scientists who were signatories to the two letters may have been acting as a classic research cartel .\nIn 2004 , Henry Bauer formulated the idea of research cartels and knowledge monopolies , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes subordinate to corporate or government values .\nA key element of knowledge monopolies and research cartels is stifling of skepticism , premature canonization of preferred hypotheses and consensus enforcement , in the interests of financial or political objectives .\nWith the help of uncritical mass media , this effectively results in near censorship of minority views .\nSince corporate and government scientific organizations also control the funding of research , by denying funds for unorthodox work they function as research cartels as well as knowledge monopolies .\nWade notes that in today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be very costly .\nCareers can be destroyed for stepping out of line .\nAny virologist who challenges the community \u2019 s declared view risks having his next grant application turned down by the panel of fellow virologists that advises the government grant distribution agency .\nThe IPCC and the \u2018 climate-industrial-government complex \u2019 is a clear example of a knowledge monopoly and research cartel .\nHowever , I don \u2019 t think that the fake consensus surrounding the Covid-19 origins reflects a research cartel .\nWhat I see is a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in protecting their personal interests .\nThe question is why The Lancet and Nature Medicine published these op-eds .\nIt is noted that Daszak had an obvious conflict of interest re the op-ed , but this conflict was not stated .\nApparently there are no adverse consequences for not accurately stating your conflicts of interest in journal publications .\nDaszak et al .\npresumably have some influence over which research gets funded , and this may have prevented other virologists with less influence from speaking out .\nHowever , the fact that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a year has more to do with Trump derangement syndrome and the desire not to appear Sinophobic .\nThe media is arguably the most culpable for a complete absence of vigorously investigative science journalism , prior to Wade \u2019 s article .\nNote that Wade \u2019 s article was published in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists , and as far as I can tell has not been picked up by major media outlets .\nWhat does all this mean for institutionalized climate science ?\nWell the IPCC , along with supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrenched as a knowledge monopoly and research cartel .\nBut the Covid origins example illuminates the social , political and careerist motivations that are in play in attempts to prematurely canonize and enforce a scientific consensus .\nIn closing , a recent essay by Mike Hulme is insightful .\nClimategate was a controversy because it appeared that climate scientists were undermining the idea of a \u2018 well-ordered science \u2019 , or what Naomi Oreskes has written about as \u2018 the conditions necessary to reach a fair and open consensus \u2019 .\nWe can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance \u2019 was real or manufactured , but my point is this : Climategate became a crisis because so much was being staked \u2013 by both ends of the political spectrum \u2013 on science providing the direction and justification for political action ( or inaction ) .\nIt was a crisis because of the undermining of the probity of the science upon which , it was believed or at least claimed , all sensible climate policy depended .\nMost notably , this included the prominent environmental commentator George Monbiot .\nClimate skepticism has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science is always bound up with other things \u2013 politics , culture , ethics , the law .\nSkepticism often arises from observing how science and expert judgement is being mobilized in debates that are essential political \u2013 in other words , climate sceptics are suspicious about how the different interests and values of public actors concerning climate change are being resolved .\nSkepticism therefore points to the problem of legitimation ; it is the problem of how science \u2013 how experts \u2013 relate , or are perceived to relate , to democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how to \u201c open up \u201d public debate and when and how to \u201c close it down \u201d , to use Andy Stirling \u2019 s metaphor .\nAnd this requires us to recognize that how one \u2018 closes down \u2019 depends on political culture : Russia , China , USA and Germany all do it very differently .\nTo stand in here , I use the case of climate scientist Michael Mann and his militarist vocabulary .\nThe German theorist Carl von Clausewitz characterized war as \u201c an act of violence intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will.\n\u201d This is not a good way to think about climate politics in a democracy .\nIn wars there are winners and losers .\nSides are taken and the solution is conquering and defeating the enemy .\nAs John Besley at Michigan State University asks , \u201c Do we want people to see scientists as angry , embattled , frustrated people \u2026 or rather people who are doing [ their ] best to solve problems to make the world better ?\n\u201d The danger with the combative climate militancy espoused by Mann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destructive form of

average of about +15 \u00b0C .\nTherefore , something must be delivering heat to the surface in addition to insolation .\nWhen looking for the sources , a hint comes from a well-known experience : clear-sky nights exhibit relatively low Earth surface temperatures while cloudy nights remain relatively warm .\nThus , the atmosphere is contributing to the heat variability at the surface , with water molecules as the dominant components @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the water content in the atmosphere is a passive reactant to otherwise driven temperatures , acting as an amplifier .\nWhen looking for the temperature driving processes , key candidates are the insolation ( in particular the varying solar activity and modulation by the planetary albedo ) , tectonic movements ( e.g .\nwith their impact on ocean and wind currents ) , large volcanic activities , forms of life , extra-terrestrial events ( bolide impacts , cosmic rays ) , and atmospheric composition beyond water content .\nApparently

concentration onto the surface-air temperature .\nThe CO2 concentration needed to be changed and for each change , its value and the corresponding temperature recorded .\nOther temperature influences needed to be negligible or well controlled .\nIt turns out that Earth has performed such an experiment in the past .\nDuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ma BP , atmospheric CO2 has steadily been removed by sequestration while recording its concentration and the corresponding temperature via proxies .\nOther temperature influences are judged negligible .\nThis assumption is considered a first-order approximation subjected to potential amendment as the time horizon and the data base widen in the course of the further analysis .\nThe span of the CO2 concentration has been from 1600 to 500 ppmv in the considered period , the temperature span from about 28 to 20 \u00b0C .\nAn interpretation of the \u2018 measurement \u2019 data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has previously been presented [ 2 , 3 ] .\nIn the present studies , these reconstruction data are found to follow a simple relationship between the CO2 concentration ( hereafter \ud835\udc5dCO2 in the unit ppmv ) and the entailed temperature ( TCO2 ) , in the further course referred to as the Eocene ( CO2-temperature ) relationship : From the historical CO2 concentrations of [ 3 ] ( here used in course representation ) , the related temperatures are determined according to the preceding Eocene relationship .\nA slight correction is applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase with time ( \u0394Tsol ) by approximating [ 5 ] via with t the time from present into the past in million years , and by applying 0.75 \u00b0C/ ( W/m2 ) for the radiative forcing-to-temperature sensitivity ( see e.g .\n[ 3 ] ) .\nIn Figure 1 , the resulting T = TCO2 + \u0394Tsol ( smooth blue line ) is compared with the \u2018 measured \u2019 data given in [ 2 ] ( orange wiggly line ) .\nThe simple logarithmic function ( equation 1 ) for the temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well able to reproduce the temperatures of the considered period 50-35 Ma BP and beyond , extending to 60 Ma BP .\nAs a sensitivity test , the two coefficients in TCO2 ( equation 1 ) are changed by \u00b11 % and the resulting temperature boundaries depicted in Figure 1 by the dotted bright-blue lines .\nFigure 1 .\nMean global annual near-surface air temperature trend for the Eocene as published by [ 2 ]

in TCO2 by \u00b11 % Conclusion from the Eocene : As the primary change process , the atmospheric CO2 concentration was steadily reduced in the period of 50 to 35 Ma BP .\nRoughly , a difference of 1100 ppmv in the CO2 concentration is followed by a temperature difference of 8 \u00b0C .\nThis causal relationship is well explained by simulation programs [ 2 , 3 ] .\nAt the same time , the simple 2-parameter logarithmic function of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship , is able to reflect the compound effect of all underlying processes .\nTo explore the general applicability of the simple Eocene relationship , it is examined for a period with heavy disturbances to the pure CO2 influence : the Late Quaternary with its dominant waxing and waning ice sheets , in cause alternating the surface albedo and thus , the absorbed surface insolation .\nThe present study is based on the Vostok ice core data [ 4 ] .\nThe herein reported CO2 concentrations are used to derive the CO2-effected temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TCO2 ) .\nThe albedo effect ( \u0394Tice-Quaternary ) is approximated with help of the also reported proxy-determined temperature variabilities ( \u0394TVostok ) of [ 4 ] by adapting the linear \u03b418O-sea level-albedo relationship of [ 3 ] via : The factor 0.2 has the meaning of \u03b1T/\u03b1p where \u03b1p the polar amplification ( in this work taken as 2 ) and \u03b1T the proportionality factor for the global mean surface temperature , hence 0.4 .\nIn Figure 2 , the resulting temperatures T = TCO2 + \u0394Tice-Quaternary are compared with the proxy-measured

.\nEach , CO2 and ice albedo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn a more general ( and correct ) view , \u0394Tice-Quaternary represents all terms not covered by TCO2 .\nFrom Figure 2 , it is inferred that the aggregate non-CO2 temperature contribution largely follows a linear relationship to the global mean surface temperature .\nFigure 3 .\nSurface temperature contributions to \u2018 T ( CO2 , albedo ) \u2019 of Figure 2 ; from CO2 : TCO2 according to the Eocene relationship ( dashed blue line , with an arbitrary offset for presentation purposes ) ; from ice albedo : \u0394Tice-Quaternary ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Late Quaternary , part 1 : By switching on ice albedo as a massive second temperature determinant in addition to CO2 , the observed temperatures are also well reproduced with help of the Eocene CO2-temperature relationship .\nThe Eocene relationship is indicated as independent of other temperature-driving forces .\nThis raises the question about the CO2-temperature relationship in the other direction : It is well known that temperature is viably directing the atmospheric CO2 concentration .\nOn the sceptics \u2019 side , there is remarkable supposition that the CO2 concentration is predominantly driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emissions during the industrial age .\nFor an examination , let us think of an experiment to measure the CO2 concentration entailed by different temperatures .\nAgain , nature has done such an experiment : in the Late Quaternary .\nBy increasing and reducing ice coverage , albedo is being varied , by this the absorbed surface insolation and in turn , the surface temperature .\nTemperature and CO2 concentration have been recorded via proxies educed from ice cores ( see before ) , and the associated time via the ice core depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is considered the predominant CO2 change agent , other CO2-determining processes judged disregardable .\nLooking at the Vostok ice core data [ 4 ] , the local temperature has varied by about 10 \u00b0C between glacial and inter-glacial maxima , and the CO2 concentration by 100 ppmv .\n10 \u00b0C temperature difference in the Vostok ice core data roughly relate to 5 \u00b0C in the global average temperatures ( see factor of 0.5 in Figure 2 ) .\nThus , a change of 1 \u00b0C of the global annual mean temperature is followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CO2 concentration .\nThis is a factor of 2 higher then resulting from theoretical research [ 7 ] , where the CO2 concentration ( pCO2 ) varies per 1 \u00b0C of temperature change according to pCO2/27 ( ppmv ) .\nFor pre-industrial pCO2 , this roughly results in 10 ppmv CO2 concentration change caused by a 1 \u00b0C temperature change .\nApplication of this theorical relationship to the temperature variabilities in the Vostok ice core data results in the CO2 concentrations as depicted by the dashed orange and dotted gray lines of Figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and raw Vostok temperatures , respectively ; the solid blue line shows the CO2 concentrations as reported from the ice cores .\nFigure 4 .\nAtmospheric CO2 concentration in the Late Quaternary ; solid blue line : course representation of proxy reconstruction [ 4 ] ; dashed orange line : computed as caused by the temperature variabilities ( proxy data of [ 4 ] times 0.5 ) according to theory [ 7 ] ; dotted gray line : as before , temperature variabilities of proxy data without factor for translation from local to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quaternary , part 2 : Nature reveals different CO2-temperature relationships for either direction : ( a ) temperature driving CO2 , ( b ) CO2 driving temperature .\nIn direction ( a ) , the atmospheric CO2 concentration follows temperature changes by 10-20 ppmv per 1 \u00b0C temperature change .\nIn direction ( b ) , a change of 10 ppmv in CO2 concentration causes a temperature change of about 0.07 \u00b0C .\nRegarding for instance a CO2 concentration increase of 100 ppmv , the Eocene relationship indicates an induced temperature increase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in turn , causes a concentration change of 7-14 ppmv , about 7-14 % of the 100 ppmv-increase is to be attributed to the entailed temperature increase .\nSo far , the Eocene CO2-temperature relationship has proven applicable for two geological ages , the Eocene and the Late Quaternary .\nThe next sections shall turn to other eons with yet different conditions .\nThe first is the time of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum ( PETM ) , circa 56 Ma BP .\nIn a previous computer simulation study [ 8 ] , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by varying the CO2 concentration up to 9 times pre-industrial levels .\nIn Figure 5 , the results of the simulation study ( blue dots connected by the solid line ) are compared with the Eocene relationship results , corrected by \u0394Tsol ( equation 2 ) for 56 Ma ( orange dots connected by the dashed line ) ; the black circle depicts the PETM condition according to [ 8 ] .\nConclusion from the PETM-study : The simple Eocene

been analyzed .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] , the related radiative forcings have been determined .\nIn Figure 6 , these forcings ( solid blue line ) are compared to those given by the Eocene relationship ( dashed orange line ) by applying a sensitivity of 1.2 \u00b0C/ ( W/m2 ) .\nFigure 6 .\nCO2 radiative forcing in the period 400-200 Ma BP ; solid blue line : radiative forcing from [ 9 ] in course representation ; dashed orange line : radiative forcing from the Eocene CO2-temperature relationship ( this work ) with 1.2 \u00b0C/ ( W/m2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ma-period : The pattern of the radiative forcing from earlier computer studies is well reproduced by the simple Eocene relationship .\nIt is noted that a sensitivity of 1.2 \u00b0C/ ( W/m2 ) is required for the agreement , whereas 0.75 \u00b0C/ ( W/m2 ) are perceived as a generally applicable standard .\nAt this point , no interpretation can be given on the sensitivity specifics of this case ; as hypothesis , the difference may predominantly be attributed to water vapor .\nSo far , the considerations have each focused on rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Eocene CO2-temperature relationship has proven as a viable tool to quantify the CO2-induced temperature variabilities .\nIn this paragraph , the entire Late Paleozoic from 400 Ma BP to present will be analyzed utilizing the Eocene relationship .\nThe CO2 data are now taken from [ 5 ] ( as in the previous 400-200 Ma study , context of Figure 6 ) , and the temperature data from [ 6 ] .\nEither data are judged coherent state-of-the-art reconstructions for the considered period .\nBoth data are shown together in Figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) line for the temperature and the orange line for the CO2 concentration .\nFigure 7 .\nReconstructed surface temperatures ( course reconstruction of [ 6 ] ) and CO2 concentrations [ 5 ] for the Late Paleozoic ; blue ( mostly upper ) line : temperature , left scale ; orange line : CO2 concentration , right scale From visual impression , the extremes exhibit rather consistent patterns : nearly the same CO2 concentrations correspond to the respective temperatures at the minima and maxima ( except at the maxima of 90 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , CO2 may lead temperature by circa 20 Ma ( 400-320 Ma BP ) or lag by 20 Ma ( 280-220 Ma BP ) .\nFrom this , it is expected improbable to extract a statistically significant correlation between the two variables \u2013 if not artificially adapted for the 20 Ma-time shifts .\nSince there is no explanation in sight for a potential time lead / lag of this order , such statistical analysis is disregarded .\nInstead , the Eocene relationship is applied to the CO2 concentrations .\nThe resulting temperatures are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line ) with a constant subtraction of 3 \u00b0C , and compared to the reconstructed ( measured ) temperatures ( solid blue line ) .\nBesides the artificial 3 \u00b0C-offset , the agreement between the two curves is perceived remarkably good .\nOne may infer that the Eocene relationship represents the major temperature driving force .\nHowever , it is known that the absorbed insolation is subject to modulations with time .\nSignificant variability is to be expected from the constantly increasing solar luminosity ( see \u0394Tsol of equation 2 ) , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( e.g .\nregarding the Late Paleozoic icehouse at around 300 Ma ) , and proposedly from the cyclic cosmic ray intensities [ 10 ] .\nFurther significant temperature influence is expected from tectonic changes ( the entire considered period covered by supercontinent Pangea assembly to break-up ) .\nFigure 8 .\nSurface temperatures ; solid blue line : geologic reconstruction , as in Figure 7 ; dashed orange line : temperature determined from the CO2 concentrations [ 5 ] via the Eocene CO2-temperature relationship minus 3 \u00b0C ( this work ) The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /\u03c6 ( 0 ) is taken from [ 10 ] and its temperature influence approximated via fit by The resulting variability of ~ 3 \u00b0C is found in consistency with [ 10 ] .\nThe tectonic changes are apparent in the paleogeographic evolvement ; Figure 9 shows a course reconstruction of [ 11 ] .\nThe temperature impact is approximated via multiplying the coverages ( in percent ) of landmass , mountains , and ice sheets by -0.2 \u00b0C/ % , and the coverages of water ( shallow waters and deep ocean ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a constant offset of -7 \u00b0C : with i indicating the tectonic types , fi the coverage-temperature impact described before , and Ci the respective coverages ( Figure 9 ) .\nFigure 9 .\nPaleogeographic evolvement with time ; Earth coverages in % from top to bottom : deep ocean ( dashed blue ) , landmass ( solid brown ) , shallow waters ( dashed bright blue ) , mountains ( solid ochre ) , ice sheets ( dotted violet ) This approach means for instance : if land gives 1 % to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the reduction of land coverage and another 0.2 \u00b0C by the simultaneous increase of the water area , in total 0.4 \u00b0C .\nOriginally introduced to explore the tectonic influences , \u0394Ttec in its given form is interpreted as predominantly reflecting albedo variabilities and in addition , overall land/water-driven climate variabilities ( shift in the coverage ratio of continental vs. warm-humid climates ) .\nTo put this into perspective , a 1 % land increase from today \u2019 s tectonics \u2013 with ocean and land coverages 0.71 and 0.29 , respectively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of [ 1 ] , and a sensitivity of 0.75 \u00b0C/ ( W/m2 ) \u2013 results in a temperature reduction of 0.26 \u00b0C .\nMore qualitatively , the albedo of water clouds is about 10 % higher over land than over oceans , 0.46 versus 0.42 [ 12 ] , contributing to higher surface insolation at oceans than at land .\nIn conclusion , the albedo interpretation of \u0394Ttec and the chosen parameter set are viewed as principally supported by separate studies .\nFor further instance , in the Late Paleozoic icehouse at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet contribution to \u0394Ttec is -2.9 \u00b0C if the ice area is recruited from water areas .\nIn summary , the total temperature is determined by The result is depicted in Figure 10 by the dashed orange line and compared to the reconstructed ( measured ) temperatures ( solid blue line ) .\nThe agreement is perceived fair , particularly regarding the extensive period of about 400 Ma covering a large variety of disparate conditions .\nThe pattern of the agreement remains principally unchanged ( not shown ) if considering the 68 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ 5 ] , the temperature discussion of [ 6 ] , and a potential sensitivity dependency on the climate state by varying the non-CO2-terms in equation ( 6 ) by \u00b11\u20443 .\nThe agreement of the present high-level consideration with observations is seen as confirmation that the major temperature-determining components have been identified and that their respective contributions can be quantified by simple approximations .\nFigure 10 .\nSurface temperatures ; solid blue line : geologic reconstruction , as in Figure 7 and Figure 8 ; dashed orange line : determined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on the Eocene CO2-temperature relationship ; dotted gray line : as before , with cosmic ray influence switched off and \u0394Ttec adapted ; dot-dashed green line : as before ( no cosmic ray influence ) , with \u0394Ttec replaced by a snow/ice albedo approximation and continental coverage ( sea level ) -to-temperature proportionality ( see text ) By nature of the approximations , the regarded contributions subsume all relevant underlying processes .\nThis particularly applies to the Eocene CO2-temperature relationship comprising e.g .\natmospheric water vapor variations with temperature , changing ocean-atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature , and the temperature influence on the CO2 concentration ( see above , Late Quaternary ) .\nTCO2 in equation ( 6 ) gives the near-surface temperature if CO2 was the only forcing .\nThe further components of equation ( 6 ) act as correction terms , each again subsuming all underlying processes .\nThese are explicitly incorporated in \u0394Tsol ( equation 2 ) by applying the sensitivity of 0.75 \u00b0C/ ( W/m2 ) and implicitly incorporated via the factors -4 and fi in \u0394Tcrf ( equation 4 ) and \u0394Ttec , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dependency of the sensitivity on the climate state is approximated as zero , cross-terms and higher-order terms in the forcing-to-temperature relationship are interpreted to be partly contained as averages in the insolation components of equation ( 6 ) ( i.e .\n\u0394Tsol , \u0394Tcrf , \u0394Ttec ) and to be partly attributed to the residuals .\nTo examine model alternatives , variations have been applied to equation ( 6 ) .\n( A ) First , the contribution from the cosmic ray flux is set to zero .\nWith the parameters of \u0394Ttec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from +0.2 to +0.3 \u00b0C/ % , and the constant to -15 \u00b0C , the temperatures are given as depicted by the dotted gray line in Figure 10 .\n( B ) From here , \u0394Ttec is replaced by two components .\n( i ) Snow/ice albedo is approximated by a linear relationship to temperature : for TCO2 + \u0394Tsol > 17 \u00b0C , the relative albedo contribution is +3 \u00b0C ; for lower temperatures , the contribution is ( TCO2 + \u0394Tsol \u2013 11.5 ) \u2219 0.545 \u00b0C .\n( ii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ocean continental coverage [ 13 ] , which is a measure for the eustatic sea level ; this temperature contribution is taken proportional as 0.2 \u00b0C per 1 % continental coverage difference with a constant offset of -6 \u00b0C .\nThis temperature contribution is interpreted to originate from albedo variabilities .\nThe resulting temperatures are shown in Figure 10 by the dot-dashed green line .\n( C ) Introduction of effects from atmospheric oxygen variabilities leads to temperatures within the ranges exhibited in Figure 10 ( therefore not shown ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple driving-force consideration can not cater for the entirety of all related processes .\nMajor contributions to the temperature variabilities are expected from strong volcanic activities ( beyond the CO2 effects ) as well as from wind and ocean currents .\nThe latter may be the cause for the deviations between about 50 and 30 Ma BP in Figure 10 which decrease by circa -4 \u00b0C during this period ( differences between solid blue and dashed orange lines in Figure 10 ) .\nSuch progressive cooling may well be ascribed to changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also the model-to-reconstruction deviations before and after the center of the late Paleozoic icehouse ( at about 300 Ma BP ) are proposed to be predominantly attributed to warming contributions from \u2013 tectonically determined \u2013 ocean current specifics , these being largely reduced in the presence of wide-spread glaciation ( i.e .\nat the center of the icehouse ) .\nThe proxy reconstructions used for the Late Paleozoic in this paragraph exhibit deviations from those used for the derivation of the Eocene relationship in \u00a7 2.1 .\nNevertheless , the original relationship of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit through the Late Paleozoic-analysis .\nFrom comparison of Figure 10 ( dashed orange line ) with Figure 8 , the summed effect of insolation variabilities ( particularly from solar luminosity ( \u0394Tsol ) and albedo ) roughly acts as a constant temperature reduction of 3 \u00b0C .\nAs example for detailed insight , the single temperature contributions to T ( equation ( 6 ) , dashed orange line in Figure 10 ) are depicted in Figure 11 .\nFigure 11 .\nSurface temperature contributions to dashed orange line of Figure 10 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @

the 68 % -pCO2 confidence envelope is used for TCO2 of the dotted gray line in Figure 10 and the results depicted by the dotted gray lines of Figure 12 .\nThe relative temperature uncertainties are emulated as 0.3 times the relative pCO2 uncertainties ( 68 % confidence ) .\nBy this , the uncertainty increase with depth into the past is accounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0.3 ) has intuitive character .\nIt is interpreted that detailed error treatment can not substantially alter the preceding considerations .\nFigure 12 .\nUncertainty consideration for reconstructed temperature and dotted gray model of

relationship is revealed to be applicable throughout ( at least ) the past 400 Ma , as resulting from comparisons with paleo-reconstructions ( Eocene , Late Quaternary , Late Paleozoic ) together with plausibility considerations on the further major climate determinants .\nCO2 delivers the major contribution to the climate variabilities .\nThe second major influence stems from the modulation of the absorbed insolation by the sun \u2019 s luminosity , the planetary albedo ( via paleogeography/tectonics , or snow/ice and sea level ) , and potentially cosmic rays .\nThe Milankovitch-cycles turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding the climate variabilities on the high level pursued in this study .\nHowever , there is room for other important contributions , particularly from ocean currents .\nAt the very least , the benefit of the present analysis is to have a handy tool for estimates , particularly to quickly size risk from the CO2-temperature relationship .\nMethodologically , the present study is based on the principle that the determining forces of a certain natural phenomenon are ( 1 ) few and ( 2 ) , clearly visible .\nThe focus has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on nature \u2019 s interplay between CO2

performed ( Eocene relationship , Late Paleozoic ) .\nIn general , the presented studies are based on long-term trends .\nThe approach presumes that the degree of agreement between approximation and

anticipated role of the ocean currents .\nThe hope is that this will facilitate differentiation in the discussions .\nSupplementary Material : All data and code are available : Simplified climate

the decline of public debate", "date": "2021-06-01", "source": "climateetc", "title": "Truth or consequences: global warming consensus thinking and the decline of public debate", "content": "The so-called debate about the causes and effects of anthropogenic global warming ( AGW ) is a notable irony .\nRather than a forum for free disputation , AGW has in recent years become the site of a consensus equating majority opinion with truth\u2014leaving little , if any , room for debate .\nAfter all , doesn \u2019 t everyone but a misguided few agree that we are in the grip of an unparalleled , man- made climatic catastrophe ?\nChallenging this consensus and its advocates often leads not to reasoned argument and coolheaded policy making but to sometimes overheated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretations .\nThis we discovered firsthand when , as close observers of AGW controversies since 2015 , we convened a conference about climate change and public policy .\nUnanticipated events preceding the conference were an unsettling enough demonstration of the rule of consensus in contemporary life .\nWorse still , subsequent inquiry revealed that the AGW conference was just the tip of a bigger and\u2014according to consensus\u2014fast-melting iceberg .\nBeyond our conference and the controversies surrounding AGW , consensus thinking adversely impacts diverse other current issues , individual awareness of them , public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of science , and collective understanding of the nature of truth .\nConference planning and the sway of consensus Our own diverse perspectives on AGW\u2014those of an entrepreneur and a physician\u2014led us to believe that the proposed conference would attract a wide range of participants .\nWe envisioned a gathering of experts from the academy , government , industry , and other interests who would debate the impact of AGW upon public policy .\nOur goal was to convene a gathering of approximately 30 speakers and 500 attendees at the conference facilities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting of our planning board and three university faculty members was cordial and evoked considerable enthusiasm for the conference\u2014until we presented our list of speakers .\nThe lineup included an even balance of individuals who were either proponents or skeptics of AGW .\nAnd , with that , we collided with the first of the consensus advocates who would take issue with our approach .\n\u201c This program of speakers is unacceptable to us , \u201d the faculty leader stated .\n\u201c It has several climate change deniers .\nYou know , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that global warming is real and that it is a consequence of human activity.\n\u201d Lacking the support of university faculty , we engaged the conference facilities of a nearby hotel and proceeded with fund-raising .\nIn August 2018\u2014just two months before the scheduled event\u2014AGW activists alerted members of the host city council to the controversial panel of speakers .\nAs a result , the city leadership rescinded their endorsement and financial support of the conference .\n\u201c It was a concern about why alternative views [ of climate change ] would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 99 percent of climate scientists , \u201d claimed one councilor to a local newspaper .\n\u201c [ It is ] reprising the whole debate about climate science.\n\u201d He didn \u2019 t want the city , which had championed several environmental issues , \u201c giving speakers like that a forum.\n\u201d Despite this setback , the conference opened as planned in October 2018 .\nA capacity audience attended , and the discussions were generally well received , with only a small contingent of university representatives betraying their scorn .\nAt its conclusion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speakers and attendees could agree .\nReviews were mixed\u2014some finding no common ground with many of the speakers \u2019 views , others praising the planners \u2019 efforts .\nOur purpose in designing the conference was to provide an educational event and discussion forum for a regional audience of policy makers , business leaders , and professional stakeholders interested in the policy implications of AGW .\nSeveral of the speakers were skeptical of the pace of global warming or of global policy favoring the rapid development of renewable energy resources in response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did we realize how polarizing the conference would be .\nIn particular , we were struck by the vehemence with which the local university scientists withdrew their cooperation upon learning the composition of the speaker panel .\nIt seemed to us that they had no interest in engaging with a discussion regarding AGW and its effects\u2014topics that , to them , closed all argument because the solutions seemed certain .\nThe loss of our municipal sponsorship and the accompanying publicity in the local press further alerted us that forces were actively at work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand what led others to disengage from us and to decline our invitation to debate raised three questions : 1 ) Why did academic scientists avoid this opportunity to consider the AGW consensus with a few of its challengers ?\n2 ) How do scientists , the media , policy makers , and the laity acquire reliable technical information upon which to base decision making ?\n3 ) What is the difference between deniers of science and skeptics of science ?\nWe asked these questions because the cultural mood at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it prompted some to boycott discussion .\nIn addressing why academic scientists spurned the conference , we might begin by considering how scientific truth differs from faith\u2014in this case , faith in the AGW consensus .\nWe sought the insights of a scholar of philosophy to guide our thesis .\nGenerally speaking , faith leads from theory to a search for evidence , whereas scientific truth derives from empirical evidence that defines a theory .\nThe distinction suggests philosophy \u2019 s query : What is truth ?\nRather than conflating truth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth that , at least for a time , can meet the rigorous test of the scientific method .\nIf we seek any form of absolute truth , we shall find it only in faith\u2014and not in empirical science .\nAs the philosopher Karl Popper suggested in The Logic of Scientific Discovery ( 1959 ) , a theory that can not be falsified is faith , not science .\nConsensus thinking should not be confused with consensus science .\nIt is a historical truism that all science tends to consensus until it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consensus forms around a new insight .\nAlfred Wegener , often considered the progenitor of continental drift theory , was derided and ostracized when he first proposed his thesis .\nOver time , empirical evidence disproved older notions , and today we take Wegener \u2019 s insight for the consensus belief .\nAnd tomorrow ?\nWe don \u2019 t know .\nNew research may lead to yet another understanding .\nTo deny that research would be to declare ourselves for a faith .\nIt seems that a body of academics today have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouting down\u2014the continuation of scientific inquiry .\nAs human knowledge expands exponentially , we must admit the possibility of many corrections and new hypotheses that may lead us to new understandings .\nNothing will serve us better than unbiased science guided by observation , the established scientific method .\nScience of this caliber not only demonstrates the transience of consensus but also , when informed by philosophy , helps elucidate the nature of truth .\nScience , truth , and the role of philosophy Since ancient times , scientific findings divergent from accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denial , and even contempt .\nSkepticism of new scientific ideas is inherent in the scientific method and ensures that fresh concepts are rigorously examined and rendered free of error before their general preferment .\nDenial and contempt , the scientific community agrees , have no place in experimental inquiry .\nYet past and present examples are easily found .\nIn the early 1960s , Judah Folkman , MD\u2014more recently a pediatric surgeon at Boston Children \u2019 s Hospital\u2014conducted research indicating that cancers require the formation of new blood vessels to sustain their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had potential for developing cancer therapeutics .\nThe ASCO Post , December 10 , 2020 , recalled the disbelief by granting agencies and mockery from competing researchers that Folkman faced ; conventional scientific wisdom judged his ideas to be too illusory for serious attention .\nThen , in 1992 , Napoleone Ferrara , a scientist at Genentech , Inc. , identified a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , a potent stimulus to new blood vessel formation .\nFolkman \u2019 s hypothesis was acquitted .\nCancer therapies targeted against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be effective against certain malignancies .\nFolkman \u2019 s experience suggests that consensus , in science and elsewhere , too readily excludes what the French call recul .\nBest understood as detachment , the term embodies the notion that , in the presence of uncertainty , a space be reserved for perspective .\nThis allows for the possibility that different forms of truth may become entangled to advantage .\nIn the 18th century , what we today take for a scientist was known as a philosopher .\nSuch was Benjamin Franklin , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThose that think science is dispassionate sense while believing philosophy to be impassioned nonsense would do well to consider Franklin : Was there a man more pragmatic ?\nWhen Franklin and Voltaire met in France , they were hailed as the Enlightenment \u2019 s union of empirical knowledge and wisdom .\nWe miss this union now , believing science complete of itself .\nThis suggests the first of four corrective truisms concerning the alliance of science and philosophy : knowledge without wisdom is a tool within an otherwise empty box .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science is widely held to be the bearer of things known .\nThis can not be , however , because empirical science , ever subject to question , can only represent a moment in time .\nIn science the known and the unknown are the obverse and reverse of one coin , one without the other being at best half an explanation .\nThus , the second truism : in all things , there exist the known and the unknown .\nA 1927 essay , \u201c Possible Worlds , \u201d by the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characterizes the universe as \u201c not only queerer than we suppose , but queerer than we can suppose.\n\u201d Science has had to face the challenge of the unknown , understanding that only by the union of philosophy and science can knowledge be advanced .\nIn Lost in Math : How Beauty Leads Physics Astray ( 2018 ) the German theoretical physicist Sabine Hossenfelder observes that \u201c science has reached a limit at which it must be rescued by philosophy.\n\u201d Earlier , in writing Dieu et la science ( 1991 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosopher , concluded that he could detect no opposition between God and science but , rather , complementarity .\nThe same might be said of philosophy and science .\nAlthough it can offer critical thinking , philosophy is not a critique of science , but an equal , complementary discipline .\nPhilosophy advances its own claims , based on a long-tested process as rigorous as the scientific method .\nThe representation in some circles that science offers absolute truth is thus in error and brings us to our third truism : science without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient Greeks understood this .\nThe word \u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03c3\u03b7 , transcribed as gnosi , encompasses what in English requires more than a word : that is , knowledge , cognition , awareness , learning , and sense .\nBeyond these lies what is not known .\nThe quantum physicist tells us , with a straight face , that the laptop upon which we write our words is , and is not , the paradox of Schr\u00f6dinger \u2019 s cat\u2014in other words , the threshold beyond which the unknown lies .\nHere we arrive at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark matter of all things , the greater part of our universe .\nHossenfelder is critical of theory in search of evidence : empirical evidence would do better in pursuit of theory .\nIn her view , lacking empirical evidence of the unknown , a coterie of physicists has taken up a game of mathematical pyrotechnics , formulating equations to support increasingly arcane hypotheses about what they can not for now explain .\nThen prejudice\u2014today called confirmation bias\u2014intrudes , whereby such fragments as may be supposed evidence are taken for whole stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who follow procedures as defined and tempered as those of empirical science .\nThe police of every land have a rule : a murder without a body is not a murder .\nIn science\u2014even , or perhaps especially , in the realm of the unknown\u2014a theory without evidence is not a theory .\nOur four truisms not only suggest a deep interconnection between science and philosophy but also help nullify the false premise that there is no truth .\nBased on our inquiry , we can affirm that truth exists and may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established in both science and philosophy .\nIt is by turning our backs on these processes that we lose ourselves .\nThe importance of understanding truth in contemporary public life In our interaction with civic authorities and the media we were bewildered about how and why they had taken a position against our conference .\nHow had they come to the judgment that our forum offered a message potentially too damaging to endorse ?\nDrawn from legitimate academic , religious , scientific , and policy centers , our speakers were not invited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who would want to attend a meeting in which everyone agreed upon a topic ?\nHence , the second question that resulted from our conference : How do scientists , the media , policy makers , the laity\u2014any of us who have a stake in learning and understanding the truth\u2014acquire reliable information to support decision making ?\nDebate about the status of truth has endured since the origins of philosophical thought .\nSome argue that truth is entirely subjective , residing in the realm of the individual observer .\nOthers insist that truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to human beings but to the laws of nature .\nMost philosophers have attempted to navigate between these two poles , noting that the first leads to skepticism while the latter is simply impossible insofar as the human observer always adds an interpretative element to even the most impartial of truths .\nWhile craving a certainty that exceeds the boundaries of human thought , the human mind is in fact prisoner of its own subjectivity .\nWe can never think beyond our own minds , perceptions , biases , and presuppositions .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ is less stable and less independent than we might want to admit .\nEven so , we are not forced to conclude that truth is only a matter of subjective understanding .\nTo take this position implies the utter collapse of truth as a working concept : if truth is a matter of each individual \u2019 s view\u2014which suggests that we accept contradictory truths , since there is nothing external to the individual by which we can verify the truth\u2014then truth , logically , ceases to exist .\nWe must avoid this skeptical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erasure of truth leads not only to the impossibility of any agreement , but also to the impossibility of any disagreement .\nWhen constructively pursued , disagreement brings with it invaluable results by requiring each individual to respond to ideas and arguments he would otherwise have ignored , either intentionally or unintentionally .\nIn short , disagreement plays the vital role of keeping dogmatism in check .\nAlthough we may not be able to entirely break free of subjectivity , it is nevertheless worthwhile to find ways to bolster our idea of truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible standards of verification .\nTo this end , we suggest that crucial to the evaluation of any truth are three kinds of verification : empirical , experiential , and logical .\nToday , most people only apply one of the three at any given moment .\nSome hold that empirical verification is the gold standard of any and all truths .\nThese are the strict materialists who maintain that seeing is the only foundation for believing\u2014loosely speaking , this is the \u201c scientific \u201d point of view .\nAmong this cohort are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaborate .\nOn the other hand , there are those who fall into the experiential camp .\nThis group is largely comprised of people who know little to nothing of how knowledge is evaluated and shared , preferring instead to appeal to their own sense of reality .\nTheir reasoning is largely emotional .\nThese include the city fathers who withdrew endorsement and support of our conference , taking on faith the judgment of others .\nFinally , there are the others who prioritize logic but who , without appealing to both experiential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get lost in the clouds .\nEach form of verification is in fact crucial to any serious inquiry .\nThrough empirical verification , we are able to see whether the claim conforms to the body of knowledge that we already have .\nExperiential verification allows us to test whether the claim conforms to our own individual experience and makes sense according to our paradigm of reality .\nThis is not mere subjectivism : we can not discount human experience , for it is the starting point of any and all knowledge .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verification\u2014is necessary .\nBecause our experiences may be partial , or even deceptive , we must abide by what is logical , even if it is not always supported by personal experience .\nEach kind of verification acts as a check on the others .\nA robust standard of truth thus maintains that a true proposition is one that satisfies all of empirical , experiential , and logical verification .\nIf a claim fails in one area it is a hypothesis , not a true proposition .\nThere is nothing wrong with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a working claim that is constantly being tested and revised .\nThere is nothing false in a hypothesis but , equally and most importantly , it is not yet true .\nSuch a rigorous standard for judging a proposition draws a firm line between hypothesis and truth\u2014thus restoring the latter to its rightful place .\nAs a result , we could end up with access to fewer truths than we might otherwise have thought , but this is not a negative .\nThe goal of inquiry is not to give all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , but to accord such status only to those ideas that have been hard won , and which have the ability to endure after we no longer have a stake in the discussion .\nIn our quest for truth , therefore , we must deal with the imprecision , peculiarities , and prejudices of the human mind and seek to diminish their agency .\nThis we found as we assembled our conference and encountered opponents dedicated to a consensus that abolished inquiry about alternative interpretations .\nFor example , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain speakers of harboring ideas that denied the impact of climate change\u2014even though the reality was otherwise .\nNeither the conference planners nor the speakers regarded themselves as deniers of climate change or its threat to the quality of life , the infrastructure , the economy , and myriad other affairs .\nSeveral speakers were skeptics and challengers of the consensus ; as analysts with alternative perspectives , they came armed with data that they submitted to public scrutiny .\nEven so , their opponents in public life and academia sought to demonize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were uttered .\nAs our conference experience suggests , zealous consensus advocates tend to assign all challengers to the category of denier .\nIf , as it seems , this proclivity is sometimes misguided , how do we definitively distinguish between denial and skepticism ?\nHence , our third question : What is the difference between deniers of science and skeptics of science ?\nA topical example points to the answer .\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has provided an unprecedented opportunity to observe the interplay of new research findings with the scientific community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the public .\nThe rapidly evolving public health emergency created an immediate need for reliable information to guide policy and to aid medical decision making .\nThe entry of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as putative therapies for the corona virus infection first gained traction in a letter to the editor of Cell Research ( published online , February 2020 ) .\nThe letter described laboratory experiments in Wuhan , China , then the epicenter of the emerging pandemic .\nTesting five common anti-infective and anti-inflammatory agents against SARS-CoV-2 infecting cultured monkey kidney cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promising antiviral activity .\nQuickly following this report was an observational study by P. Gautret et al .\n( International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents , published online , March 20 , 2020 ) wherein 26 patients with test-proven COVID-19 were treated with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin ( a common antibiotic ) and compared to 16 control patients treated at another hospital without hydroxychloroquine .\nThe authors suggested that the hydroxychloroquine-treated patients efficiently reduced viral carriage when compared to the untreated patients .\nThis thread of evidence led to widespread application of hydroxychloroquine to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bright , PhD , Director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority of the US Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) , was a vocal proponent of allocating congressionally mandated funds for \u201c safe and scientifically vetted solutions , and not for drugs , vaccines , and other technologies that lack scientific merit.\n\u201d ( CNN Politics , April 22 , 2020 ) .\nWhen demoted to a lesser position within the HHS , he alleged that this was retaliation for his challenging the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in treating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I limited the broad use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine , promoted by the Administration as a panacea , but which clearly lack scientific merit.\n\u201d He left government service in October 2020 .\nSubsequently , multiple observational studies of hydroxychloroquine use appeared in the literature , most showing lack of efficacy , several indicating a higher risk of death .\nThis example illustrates the importance of the distinction between \u201c science denial \u201d and \u201c science skepticism.\n\u201d Dr .\nBright was skeptical of the utility of hydroxychloroquine based upon , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge confirming its efficacy and safety .\nHe denied no science ; he was victimized for rejecting the politically motivated belief in hydroxychloroquine as a therapy for COVID-19 .\nWhat characterizes science denial ?\nIn 2009 , Chris Hoofnagle , a Ph.D. physiologist , published a blog in the Guardian that lists the features of denialism in scientific research : 1 ) alleging that scientific consensus involves conspiring to falsify data or suppress the truth ; 2 ) citing fake experts or individuals while marginalizing , demonizing , or denigrating published experts ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers ; 4 ) making unreasonable demands upon research , claiming that any uncertainty invalidates the findings while rejecting probabilities and mathematical models ; 5 ) comparing apples and oranges , promoting false equivalencies among competing ideas , or drawing flawed conclusions from scientifically valid research .\nAs this list demonstrates , there is clearly an element of intended obfuscation by science denialists , who often deploy propagandistic techniques to cripple the arguments of their rivals .\nThe skeptic is a different creature altogether .\nSome speakers at our conference and others who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong to a cohort of individuals whose skepticism of certain scientific theories and resultant policy decisions offers an important service to the community .\nThey demand rigor in scientific analysis , provide alternative interpretations of events , and enforce a critical reexamination of the facts .\nWe carefully vetted the credentials of our conference speakers who , to support their arguments , came with data published in peer- reviewed literature .\nNevertheless , they were subjected to the same berating accorded the charlatans of science denial .\nIn The Climate Skeptics ( 2004 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institute for Climate Impact Research attempts to disqualify the skeptics \u2019 influence , arguing that climate researchers end up in a compromised position whether or not they engage in debate .\nHe then contradicts himself by calling for a public exchange of scientific ideas : \u201c Extreme opinions of individuals or dubious arguments can not prevail where there is broad and open discussion among specialist scientists.\n\u201d Exactly !\nWas that not our stated purpose in holding the conference ?\nUnlike science denial\u2014which actively challenges or passively ignores accepted science , using dissuasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bespeak a plausible alternative interpretation of the evidence .\nFor an expert scientific authority to assume a priori that the skeptic has nothing of value to offer seems to us an intellectually undignified position to assume .\nClosure of dialogue with those articulating any skepticism for AGW is explicitly unscientific .\nWhy would traditional academic scientists stonewall inquiry challenging the consensus ?\nAccording to Fostering Integrity in Research ( National Academies of Sciences , Engineering , and Medicine , 2017 ) , the answer is as banal as human nature , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fear of impugning the views of one \u2019 s colleagues , losing esteem in one \u2019 s discipline , or diminishing the importance of one \u2019 s research ; and desire for personal gain , whether in the form of money , power , promotion , grants , sponsorship , patronage , or prestigious employment .\nAt their most benign , such motivations may be no more than annoyances among colleagues and supervisors ; at their worst , they may contribute to scientific disinformation , misconduct , or fraud .\nWe conjecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conference as a consequence of their devotion to AGW consensus .\nPerhaps they perceived a number of our speakers as direct threats to a career \u2019 s worth of work .\nOr perhaps they just preferred to vilify our lecturers rather than to engage in discussion .\nWe believe that the city fathers who withdrew endorsement of our meeting were simply following the persuasive power of the AGW consensus advocates .\nIt is doubtful that they , not being experts , discerned any advantage to disputing the consensus .\nAt worst , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courage to assail the controversy .\nThe cost of consensus : four lessons Our experience of creating a conference of honest and balanced inquiry for the community furnished the following lessons : First , the academics with whom we sought a collaboration clearly evinced a climate change chauvinism favoring a narrative of AGW that excludes discussion of alternative understandings .\nWe were perhaps na\u00efve in our belief that experts representing both AGW advocacy and skepticism could , on equal footing , share a panel .\nSecond , in the minds of climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indistinguishable appellations .\nUnder the regime of a \u201c 97 percent scientific consensus , \u201d skepticism is given no quarter .\nThe unwillingness of card-carrying scientists and experts to engage in the climate discussion with skeptical scientific peers and professionals was baffling to us ; the vindictiveness of the AGW proponents was a shock .\nThird , the fractious demeanor shown within the climate consensus group translates equally well to other belief federations .\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has been witness to its share of scientific disinformation and bias .\nThere are undoubtedly smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empiricism having shown itself to be a surer guide than speculation , truth in science requires consideration of all observations , and these must be as readily available and unfiltered as evidence presented to a jury , whether by saints or scoundrels , whether credible or not .\nA poor substitute for such truth , consensus advocacy exacts its price from society and culture .\nWithout unrestricted access to information and opinion , we are left under the control of the anointed of the day\u2014all those who , with apparent impunity , erect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance knowledge .\nTruth reposes with us individually\u2014a collective is never accountable .", "author": "curryja", "url":

discrimination against anyone right-of-center \u2014 qualifies as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( I think ) a generalization of the process that Judith described with regard to the Wuhan Coronavirus .\nI hope readers will come away with the notion that the process of institutionalizing , and then defending , bad , politicized science is fractal\u2014the internal geometry is very similar for most all such instances .\nThe reason is because mainstream practitioners of science have a demonstrable political bias and discredit or reject the work of anyone whose beliefs are inconsistent with that bias .\nBeen there .\nIn the academy the free interchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , disagreement , debate , and dissent .\nKaufmann \u2019 s landmark study proves that the last three in that list are severely suppressed and punished .\nThe pervasiveness of such repression may be a death sentence for science , free inquiry , and the advancement of knowledge in our universities .\nI am led to that dire conclusion because the universities appear to have no way to prevent this fate .\nNo solution can arise from within the academy because it selects its own lifetime faculty , which is largely left wing\u2014increasingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlikely .\nKaufmann demonstrates profoundly systemic discrimination by leftist faculty against colleagues they find disagreeable .\nIt is important to note that Kaufmann concentrates primarily ( but not exclusively ) on the social sciences and humanities , in part because that \u2019 s where most previous research on bias applies .\nData for STEM ( science , technology , engineering , mathematics ) are not as common .\nHowever , there is no a priori reason to believe that these fields are unaffected by systemic biases influencing entire institutions .\nSure , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apolitical , but one can \u2019 t say the same for the many branches of science that now have considerable and controversial policy implications .\nEven a casual reading of both the academic and popular literature on environmental science and climatology reveals rampant politicization .\nKaufmann \u2019 s study is shocking in its depth , even to academics ( like me ) who experienced for decades what he describes .\nHe documents all aspects of an academic career , from advanced graduate study to landing a faculty position , research funding , publication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progression is all but derailed if a person expresses a scintilla of non-left views in casual conversations , faculty meetings , public discourse , teaching , grant applications , submitted publications , or the promotion process .\nHe surveys the United Kingdom , the United States , and Canada using different markers for liberal and conservative views .\nAmong others , in the U.S. he used Trump-versus-Biden support , while for the U.K. he centered upon \u201c leave \u201d or \u201c remain \u201d in the controversy over membership in the European Union .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d and \u201c soft \u201d discrimination .\nThe former includes the direct use of university disciplinary procedures against dissenting academics , internally generated campaigns for ouster , or simply making life so uncomfortable that a scholar feels compelled to leave .\nMore specifically , he defines it as \u201c being fired or threatened for one \u2019 s views , \u201d while the \u201c soft \u201d version includes \u201c not being hired , promoted , awarded a grant , or published in a journal.\n\u201d There is some good news here , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaufmann found that \u201c most academics reject the \u201c hard \u201d version , \u201d though he also found an alarming order-of- magnitude increase in the number of reported cases in recent years .\nIt is the soft version that has been more prevalent .\nPromotion is largely determined by a record of academic publication summarized by outside reviewers , who may number up to a dozen or so .\nThis decision on promotion is especially critical in the sixth year of an academic appointment , when a candidate is either promoted from assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an appointment without term ( i.e.\n, tenure ) , or is terminated within a year .\nThis review is an \u201c up or out , \u201d which means that denial of promotion ends employment not only at the candidate \u2019 s institution but at its peer institutions .\nFor candidates denied by top-shelf schools , the opportunity to play ball at a lower level usually remains .\nBut who wants to be damaged goods playing for the Tennessee Smokies after six years in Wrigley Field ?\nOne critical letter among the large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a denial .\nAnd in highly politicized fields like my own ( climate change ) unsolicited letters from a big power in the field can appear out of the blue .\n( \u201c I heard you are considering Dr. Blow for tenure .\nMight I offer some commentary ?\n\u201d ) If the writer is of sufficient status , that \u2019 s a death sentence for the candidate and his heterodox views ( pronoun and adjective explicitly chosen as matters of probability ) .\nKaufmann writes that \u201c there will be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room [ i.e.\n, fellow faculty or review letters ] discriminating against a right-wing candidate.\n\u201d With regard to all-important academic publications , he finds that a \u201c paper is unlikely to be judged strictly on its merits since most journals require at least two referees plus an editor to take a look .\nThis means there is a 60-90 % chance of a right-wing paper being rated lower \u201d ( i.e.\n, rejected ) , lowering the chances for promotion .\nThere is already a tremendous numerical disparity between left- and right-leaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. , as shown in Table 4 in Kaufmann \u2019 s paper .\nThis is for the social sciences and the humanities ; Kaufmann ( personal communication ) indicates the number for STEM is 5.7 to 1 , still an outrageous imbalance .\nKaufmann did find that discrimination by the right against the left occurs at about the same rate , but since there are so few on the right , the disparity in favor of the left will continue to grow as the papers , promotions , and grant applications of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion on the left .\nInterestingly , the percentages for conservative discrimination against left-leaning faculty are the same with regard to hiring , but the left discriminates slightly more than the right in reviews of academic papers and grant applications and in promotion decisions .\nBecause hiring decisions largely rest with the faculty members themselves , discrimination against conservatives is only going to continue increasing .\nMaybe academic discrimination is an inherent human quality , but having it entirely on one side of the political spectrum is a result of institutional hiring and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a naked threat against the diversification of knowledge , with a future that looks even worse : Kaufmann finds that the youngest cohort on the academic ladder , Ph.D. students , are the most intolerant of the few faculty who are right-of-center .\nEighty-two percent of these students say they would discriminate against right-leaning faculty in hiring , promotions , and grant applications .\nKaufmann writes that in \u201c North America , 24 % of all PhD students would [ downrate ] a right-leaning paper\u2026 .\n30 % would mark a right-leaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would rank a right-leaning grant application down.\n\u201d But that \u2019 s only the \u201c admitted \u201d bias .\nKaufman designed his surveys to also reveal hidden bias , which , he notes , approximately doubles the figures for admitted prejudice .\nDiscrimination against conservatives by Ph.D. students then becomes 48 percent , 60 percent , and 66 percent , respectively \u2014 this from the next generation of faculty .\nThis is an ominous sign , predicting that discrimination against the few remaining right-leaning teachers will become even worse .\nUniversities might as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caveat that \u201c right-of-center candidates expecting promotion need not apply.\n\u201d Kaufmann concludes , \u201c There is a climate of political discrimination inside the contemporary university \u201d and adds that \u201c findings accumulated over a decade convincingly show that a majority of conservative academics experience a hostile environment for their beliefs\u2026 .\nThis is a rational appraisal of the significant structural discrimination against them in the higher education sector.\n\u201d This climate is eroding free speech , with overt censorship by rejecting publication of results with real ( or simply apparent ) connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous self- censorship both in the classroom and in published academic papers .\nScientists ( including me ) rationally submit papers that will not ruffle feathers , which itself has the obvious effect of reducing the disagreement often required for scientific progress .\nThe result is a systematic poisoning of the peer-reviewed literature , which society accepts as its canon of knowledge .\nFewer trends in the world of ideas could be more dangerous .\nThis is the Frankfurt School on steroids .\nThe scientific literature is the basis for the development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kuhn repeatedly demonstrated in his famous 1962 book , The Structure of Scientific Revolutions ( which continues to be republished ! )\n, paradigms are highly resistant to change .\nIt took 100 years for mainstream geology to accept continental drift , even though most observant five-year-olds see that many of the world \u2019 s continents fit together like jigsaw pieces .\nPublication of results showing anomalies in a paradigm ( such as drifting continents in a paradigm of stationarity ) is difficult enough .\nIn today \u2019 s highly politicized arenas ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example ) , results that may indicate that a paradigm is inaccurate will be systemically suppressed , and their authors harassed , cancelled , or worse .\nFor instance , it is somewhat easy to download upper-atmospheric data from the climate models that serve as the ( only ) basis for assessment of future climate in the literature .\nThese data reveal massive systematic overprediction of warming in the last 40 years for the entire four-dimensional global tropics .\nYet publishing that fact in the scientific literature has proven nearly impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewed as a right-of-center finding and is treated as such .\nThe increasing systemic bias against such findings makes paradigms even more resistant to change than they were .\nTo belabor the point , the reigning paradigm is that these climate models supply reliable guidance for the future , but the implication of the global tropical error is that they don \u2019 t .\nNonetheless , the literature either doesn \u2019 t note this or downplays its meaning .\nIt \u2019 s hard not to see how politically consequential this is .\nWhy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c left \u201d , and seeing the climate as a modestly warming metastable system is \u201c right \u201d is a mystery , but the ensuing discrimination is a reality .\nIn my experience climate science is as systemically fraught with bias as the social sciences and the humanities ; indeed , Mitchell Langbert in 2018 found that the ratio of Democrats to Republicans was 25:1 among environmental scientists and 27:1 in the geosciences .\nHis results were based upon voter registration .\nDespite its obvious political prominence , in Kaufmann \u2019 s entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word \u201c climate \u201d ( used 195 times ) only describes the social milieu that academics experience .\nOnly once does the subject of global warming come up \u2014 and in a pejorative way : \u201c \u2026 [ T ] hose who refuse to recognize the reality of political discrimination and chilling effects are not dissimilar to those who initially denied the leftist makeup of the professoriate ( up to the 1990s ) , or who say that the earth is no warmer today than it was a century ago.\n\u201d To be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly warmer now than it was around 1900 .\nBut there were two warming periods in the 20th century , and the first , from 1910-45 , is unlikely to have been largely because of carbon dioxide , as atmospheric concentrations at its initiation were barely\u2014only a few parts per million\u2014above where they were when global temperature records begin in 1850 .\nIf that teeny change could kick off the half-degree ( C ) of warming that ensued , current temperatures would be so hot that there would be little debate about imminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion about long-term climate records .\nAlmost all of the warming in U.S. history ( which contains the best-maintained and most dense stations ) is a result of \u201c adjustments \u201d and \u201c homogenization.\n\u201d ( I love that word applied to ostensibly independent data records . )\nSo the true warming is actually unknown .\nWhile it is certainly a stretch to say the earth \u2019 s temperature is the same as it was a century ago , it is not one to say that surface temperature records have been molested to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmable by examining independent records from ascending weather balloons and orbiting satellites .\nI speculate that Kaufmann knows these problems beset the \u201c environmental issue of our time , \u201d but chose to avoid conflict by conflating skeptics of an imminent apocalypse with those who deny left-wing bias in the academy .\nHe may have sensed that touching the rather prominent electrified rail of climate change would have fried his credibility , no matter how well-grounded his work is .\nKaufmann often speaks of \u201c self-censorship \u201d among academics .\nDid he do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work from the type of attacks he so thoroughly documents ?\nFor whatever reason , in Academic Freedom in Crisis , mum \u2019 s the word on climate change .\nA practical example of the consequences of this intolerance is instructive .\nFor whatever reason , scientists who view modern warming as modest , harmless or even beneficial are viewed as right-wing .\nIf they let their sympathy for this so-called \u201c lukewarm \u201d hypothesis be known in graduate school , it \u2019 s unlikely they would ever gain an academic job .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ view at faculty meetings , they will be stigmatized , greatly diminishing their chances for promotion .\nFurther , revealing a \u201c lukewarm \u201d perspective in a research-grant application would be extremely risky .\nKaufmann \u2019 s results \u201c suggest close to two-thirds likelihood that each reviewer of a right- leaning grant application will engage in political discrimination [ emphasis in original ] .\n\u201d Given that there will be at least three reviewers of a grant application to , say , the National Science Foundation and that one bad review will spell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view ( established , that is , by the enormous disproportion of left-leaning faculty who view climate change as deadly ) had better self-censor .\nBetter to avoid hot-button issues and concentrate on nugatory research .\nI did that during my first decade in the academy .\nThe dean told me it was a great work , but I thought it was terrible .\nKaufmann predicts that this kind of self-censorship , or research dilution , must be common among those who dissent from left-wing orthodoxy .\nThis is perhaps most obvious in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the unholy trinity of diversity , equity , and inclusion .\nThere is surely research in the publication stream today demonstrating the benefits of increasing permutations of the gender tree and the obvious salutary effects of asserting white fragility .\nConversely .\nrest assured that anyone foolish enough to have submitted an academic counterargument has already had that manuscript rejected and is likely under academic suspicion .\nSelf-censorship applies to what one says to colleagues as well as to what research is applied for or written .\nAccording to Kaufmann , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the U.S. say there is a hostile climate for their beliefs in their departments and a similar number report self-censoring in teaching and research.\n\u201d Discrimination leads to self-censorship , curbing the freedom to investigate and debate ideas that is the lifeblood of a properly functioning academy .\nWith just 10-20 % of Trump- and Leave-supporting academics in the social sciences and humanities willing to air their political beliefs , the views of half the electorate are effectively being silenced , limiting the kinds of conversations that are needed for mutual understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious .\nThe implications are clear .\nThe opportunity costs to society of handicapping , slowing , or preventing publication of new knowledge can only be staggering , prompting the obvious question : \u201c What is to be done ?\n\u201d One , I fear , is wishful thinking : good ideas\u2014tolerance , academic freedom , and a true ideological diversity with real impact on the future composition of the faculty\u2013will prevail .\nThey will drive out the bad ones .\nWhy is it wishful thinking ?\nUniversity faculty members , after six- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave or are fired after the promotion review , are permanent lifetime employees who choose the new hires , whether tenured or not .\nKaufmann shows whom they do not choose , which implies whom they do .\nLike begets like , and people don \u2019 t often move philosophically from left to right , when the left is preferentially rewarded .\nKaufmann \u2019 s other approach is what he calls \u201c interventionist \u201d .\nHe gives an example in which a U.S. president or a governor , backed by the legislature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all other goals and programs subservient to that .\nOn the insightful British video podcast Triggernometry he noted that the U.K. government under Boris Johnson has instituted reforms that could help break the ideological uniformity of the academy .\nBut that \u2019 s the U.K .\nIn the U.S. no president or governor could successfully order universities to hire and promote more right-leaning teachers .\nNor could he or she order faculty members to affirmatively review right-of-center journal submissions , grant proposals or applications for promotion .\nSurely , one might argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now with affirmative action and \u201c diversity , equity , and inclusion.\n\u201d But no one promoting these , from lobbyists to legislators to university administrators , is pushing anything that the existing faculty don \u2019 t believe in already .\nA university administrator would get no further than a president or governor .\nThe easiest way for a university president to be deposed is for him or her to incur mass disapproval of the faculty .\nFurther , faculty members directly vote on whom to offer academic positions .\nWhile deans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ votes , they simply can \u2019 t cram an alternative appointment down a noncompliant faculty \u2019 s throat without a major giveback .\nThe most they can usually do is offer a department a \u201c free \u201d position ( one that doesn \u2019 t cost a department a designated \u201c slot \u201d ) in addition to the hire that the dean wants .\nThat might slightly dilute the hegemony of the left-of-center faculty , but the math is clear .\nIt will not replace it .\nThis is depressing , for it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is inevitable .\nOur problems are structural and intractable .\nBecause the university faculty is empowered to dictate who its members are and what is permitted in the canon of knowledge , it will retain that corrupt absolute power .\nSelf-selection by the faculty ensures an increasingly leftward tilt , not just in the social sciences and humanities ; as the infection has now reached STEM .\nPolitical intolerance will increase , as will de facto and direct suppression of academic free speech .\nIt encourages heinous self-censorship that silences teachers who might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About the author .\nPatrick J.

Change, Extreme Weather, and Electric System Reliability", "content": "I recently participated in a Technical Conference sponsored by the U.S. Federal Electricity Reliability Commission ( FERC ) .\nThis was a very interesting conference .\nUnfortunately there is no podcast or record of the written statements submitted by the panel The main part of my written statement is provided below The remarks that follow respond to issues raised for Panels # 1 and # 2 , in context of CFAN \u2019 s experience in dealing with extreme weather- and climate-related issues for the energy sector .\nHow extreme can it get ?\nExtreme weather events are rare , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremes , several different approaches are used : \u2022 incremental changes to # 1 \u2013 # 3 associated with manmade global warming .\nThe extreme events of 2020 ( e.g .\nTX cold , record number of hurricane landfalls , extensive fires in CA ) belie the utility of a 1-in-10 or 1-in-20 year standard .\nThe return period approach doesn \u2019 t help much either .\nFor example , Texas saw three 500-year floods during 2015-2017 .\nThe 100-year event is not based on history , but on estimated probabilities that assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the climate is not stationary on any time scale \u2013 apart from the secular trend of global warming , there is multi-decadal to millennial scale natural climate variability that provides an envelope for decadal and interannual climate variability .\nHere is an anecdote that relates to a client who needed help in assessing the vulnerability to hurricanes of a new power plant that was to be located on the Gulf of Mexico coast .\nA risk assessment firm calculated 100-yr storm surge to be 10.1 ft , and the 500-year storm surge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the historical hurricane record shows an estimated storm surge of 12 feet near that location in the 1920s , and an estimated 15 ft storm surge from a hurricane in the 1840 \u2019 s \u2013 periods with significantly cooler climates than now .\nNeither conventional statistics on return periods or climate model-driven expectations of slightly more intense hurricanes by 2100 provide a complete picture of what the power plant may be facing over the next 30-50 years from a hurricane storm surge .\nWhen I recommended moving the power plant inland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously approved for an earlier power plant , and getting a new site approved would take a decade .\nIn assessing the risk from extreme weather events , I advise clients to develop an understanding of the entire historical record of events impacting the locale , as well as any relevant paleoclimatic data that is available .\nIf it has happened before , it can happen again .\nWhat about the role of global warming in changing the intensity or frequency of extreme weather events ?\nApart from the a reduced frequency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global warming in the statistics of extreme weather events remains much smaller than that from natural climate variability , and is expected to remain so at least until the second half of the 21st century .\nRather than focusing on the relatively small and uncertain impacts of global warming on extreme events , a broader range of extreme weather events from the historical record can provide a better basis for avoiding \u2018 big surprises.\n\u2019 How can we assess regional vulnerability to weather extremes for the next 30 years ?\nWhile much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 2100 from global climate models , the electric utilities sector needs projections of regional climate variability and change on decadal time scales .\nTo bridge this gap , there is a growing number of companies and university groups that are producing regional , decadal climate projections from global climate model simulations .\nSpecifically , the 21st century climate simulations prepared for the IPCC assessment reports are bias-corrected based on a comparison of historical climate simulations with observations .\nThe same bias correction is applied to the 21st century simulations , which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizontal resolution .\nThe downscaling approach may be statistical or dynamical ; dynamical downscaling uses the coarser resolution outputs from a global climate model simulation as the boundary conditions for higher-resolution simulation using a regional climate model .\nThe problems with using global climate models as a basis for assessing future regional weather extremes are : \u2022 The climate model simulations used for the IPCC assessment reports include only scenarios for future emissions ; they do not include predictions of natural climate variability ( solar output , volcanic eruptions or the evolution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because the global climate models do not adequately represent the multi-decadal ocean circulations , they do a poor job at simulating regional and decadal-scale climate variability .\n\u2022 Climate models do not accurately simulate the magnitude or frequency of extreme weather events .\n\u2022 Downscaling doesn \u2019 t help , if the underlying global climate model is not producing an accurate simulation .\nIn the absence of climate models that are fit-for-purpose for predicting future extreme weather events on regional and decadal time scales , alternative methods are being developed .\nCFAN has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of regional extreme weather events for the next 30 years .\nThis approach combines historical data and climate dynamics analysis with scenarios of natural climate variability plus the outputs from global climate models .\nMultiple scenarios are selected for each driver of the forecast \u2013 emissions , solar , volcanoes and large-scale ocean circulations \u2013 with an emphasis on plausible scenarios , rather than extreme scenarios that can not completely be ruled out .\nBased on recent information provided by the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) , emissions scenarios to 2050 are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RCP6.0 scenarios ( not the oft-used extreme RCP8.5 scenario ) .\nThe multiple outcomes derived from different combinations of the scenarios for each driver are organized using a possibility diagram that portrays the distribution of scenario outcomes .\nThe likelihood of a particular outcome is associated with the plausibility of the input scenarios and also the number of different combinations of inputs that produce a particular outcome .\nRegional extreme weather events are then linked to these scenarios of climate change .\nThis linkage is made through an analysis that relates the extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns and global temperature change .\nIn several regional climate impact assessment projects that have involved CFAN , the client has hired 2-3 different groups to assess the regional impacts of climate change .\nApart from different methodologies , such assessments invariably involve expert judgment , and \u2018 which expert \u2019 matters .\nThe bottom line is that currently there is no generally accepted \u2018 best practice \u2019 for making regional projections of extreme weather events on a decadal time scale .\nOverall , the climate research community has not focused on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of extreme weather events .\nGiven the importance of such projections for adaptation to climate change , FERC could usefully motivate a focus on these applications .\nHowever , in my opinion there has been an over-emphasis on manmade climate change as the cause of increasing extreme weather events .\nNatural climate variability remains the largest driver of variations in extreme weather events , with at most incremental changes associated with manmade global warming .\nGreater attention is needed to understanding the full range of climate variability that contributes to extreme weather events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disasters occurred in the 1930 \u2019 s and 1950 \u2019 s , a period that was not significantly influenced by manmade global warming .\nThe 1970 \u2019 s and 1980 \u2019 s were a relatively quiet period , with weather disasters increasing again in the 21st century .\nThe evolution of natural multi-decadal modes of climate variability suggest that we could see another quiet period in coming decades , followed by a more active period .\nUntil the influence of natural climate variability on extreme weather is better understood , we may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their attribution to manmade global warming .\nAs the time horizon of a weather or climate forecast increases and the spatial scale decreases , forecast uncertainty increases .\nFor a very short-term weather forecast , the uncertainty in the forecast is low and there is deterministic skill .\nOn timescales of 1-14 days , ensemble global weather forecast models provide meaningful probabilities in the sense of the forecasted mean being better on average than a climatological forecast , and the 90 % range of the ensemble envelope nearly always bounds the actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are forecast periods with \u2018 windows of opportunity \u2019 where the forecasts do better than climatology , but often the actual outcome occurs outside of the bounds of the 90 % range of the ensemble forecast .\nOn seasonal time scales of 2 to 9 months , forecasts are commonly presented in terciles , with outcome probabilities provided for near average and above and below average outcomes .\nThe collection of climate model simulations to 2100 used by the IPCC are not predictions ; they should be interpreted as a sensitivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of emissions .\nThese simulations are possible outcomes that are contingent on the assumptions made about : emissions , the lack of variability in solar and volcanoes , and the absence of meaningful phasing of the multi-decadal ocean circulation patterns .\nAttempts to create probabilities from the CMIP climate model simulations and regard them as predictions lead to misleading interpretations .\nWith regards to CFAN \u2019 s regional decadal projections , the objective is to bound the range of plausible outcomes for the frequency of extreme events and the plausible worst case .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the individual outcomes , which is referred to as scenario uncertainty .\nElectric utilities are vulnerable to extreme heat and cold waves , hurricanes , wildfires , flooding , droughts and wind gusts , with regionally-varying levels of risk from each of these .\nThere are two broad approaches for reducing vulnerability to extreme weather events : \u2022 Tactical adaptation \u2013 planning and strategies for readiness and mitigation of damage from an anticipated severe event .\nStrategic adaptation in terms of infrastructure and reserve capacity is developed in response to expected conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 years ) .\nThe question then becomes \u2018 how much resilience can you afford ?\n\u2019 This is a choice between the robustness provided by 1-in-10 year versus 1-in-20 year standards .\nIt is not cost effective to harden the infrastructure to accommodate every plausible worst-case weather scenario , which may not occur during the infrastructure lifetime of 30-50 years .\nWhen an extreme event occurs that is outside of the expectations used in designing the infrastructure , too often the response is to passively watch a cascading disaster unfold and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be developed from considering plausible worst case scenarios .\nSuch strategies develop response protocols and then deploy them in a phased manner in response to probabilistic weather forecasts .\nSuch strategies can result in better outcomes , with less damage and more rapid restoration of services , Since 2013 , CFAN has been working with an electric utility provider whose service region is impacted by hurricanes .\nReconstructed landfalling winds from historical hurricanes are used to drive their outage models to produce a range of possible outage scenarios .\nA catalog of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for stress-testing their system using their outage model and for assessing their response strategies .\nWhen there is a possibility of a hurricane expected to impact their region , risk management begins 7 days prior to the possible landfall .\nCFAN provides extended-range probabilistic forecasts of tropical cyclone tracks , intensity and landfall winds that are used to drive their outage models .\nBased on CFAN \u2019 s ensemble forecasts of landfall winds , estimates are made of manpower requirements , allowing for early requests for mutual aid so that repair crews are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landfall .\nThe catalog of synthetic worst-case storms is used to assess the worst-case possibility for the pending landfall .\nMy main point is that protocols developed for worst-case scenarios can be usefully deployed for forecasted extreme events to produce better outcomes .\nThere were 5 panels at the Conference ; I participated in Panel 2 .\nHere the questions formulated for the first three panels .\nThese questions obviously address very important issues , and the formulation of the questions is interesting in itself .\nThis panel will explore the ways in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in resource adequacy planning , transmission planning , integrated resource planning , and asset development and management\u2014should evolve to achieve outcomes that reflect consumer needs for reliable electricity in the face of patterns of climate change and extreme weather events that diverge from historical trends .\nThe panel may include a discussion of the following topics and questions : \u2022 With respect to typical inputs to planning , such as expected future load , weather , temperature , etc.\n, how can such futures-based inputs be projected more accurately ( or usefully ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2022 Are there best practices for developing probabilistic/stochastic methods for estimating these typical planning inputs , including through use of expert-developed climate scenarios such as the Representative Concentration Pathway ( RCP )

reductions will be felt in the 22nd century and beyond .\nWhether or not warming is \u2018 dangerous \u2018 is an issue of values , about which science has nothing to say .\nAccording to the IPCC ,

inadequate approaches .\nHow should we approach assessing whether and how much manmade global warming has contributed to recent record breaking temperatures ?\nRead on for some outside-the-box thinking on this .\nMuch has been written in recent weeks on the record-breaking heat wave in the US Northwest and Canada There have been four categories of scientific contributions to answering this question , that have appeared in the media , blog posts and publications : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off in the media Climate scientists are writing op-eds and spouting off on twitter , about AGW causing , or at least exacerbating , the heat wave .\nScientists in this category are those who spout off on the topic , use heat waves to advocate for their preferred climate policies , without having done any actual work on the topic .\nFor one high profile example , see this article in the NYTimes by Michael Mann : Climate change is behind the heat dome .\nOne argument in the hot air line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : as the average temperatures increase , then the frequency of heat extremes increases also .\nHowever , analysis of historical data belies this simple interpretation : Need for caution in interpreting extreme weather statistics For an easier to read summary , see this report by Prescient Weather , which shows that the higher moments of the temperature distributions are critical also , and that the variance may be decreasing .\nThe other piece of the hot air argument relates to a hypothesis that the jet stream is made \u2018 wavier \u2019 by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael Mann among others .\nThere is a ton of recent papers debunking this idea , and some recent papers even suggest that high-pressure domes such as occurred during the heat wave will weaken under global warming .\nIt is intellectually lazy for scientists to spout off on this ( or any other topic ) without actually having done some work on the topic or at least having read and analyzed recent research on the topic .\nA convenient , but unjustified , storyline that supports your activism and preferred policies is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following analysis of historical data , included in Cliff Mass \u2019 blog post : As shown below , there IS NO INCREASING TREND for more record high temperatures over our region ( Oregon , Washington ) during the past century .\nIn fact , the past decade ( 2011-2020 ) had no all-time records .\nAverage number of days with temperatures above 99F in OR , WA ?\nAlso no trend .\nThese results are consistent with what others have found .\nFor example , the U.S. National Climate Assessment found the warmest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually COOLED between a historic ( 1901-1960 ) and a contemporary period ( 1986-2016 ) .\nDr. Nick Bond , Washington State Climatologist , said that he and Associate State Climatologist Karin Bumbaco found similar results , published in a peer-reviewed paper .\nA single heat wave event can be evaluated against the historical record of previous historical heat waves ( e.g .\npast ~100 years ) .\nApart from some technical disputes surrounding which data set , the perils of homogenization , etc.\n, what exactly is the logic for using historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nA .\nIf a record is set , does that lead to a necessary conclusion that AGW was a major contributing cause ?\nB .\nIf a record is not set , does that lead to a necessary conclusion that AGW was not a major contributing cause ?\nC. If there is an underlying trend in heat wave frequency at that location , does that lead to a necessary conclusoin that AGW was a major contributing cause for a single heat wave event ?\nD. If there is no underlying trend in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does that lead to a necessary conclusion that AGW was not a major contributing cause for a singe heat wave event ?\nE. If there is a global trend in frequency/severity heat wave events , does that say anything conclusive about a role ( or not ) of AGW in influencing a single local heat wave event ?\nF. Does the magnitude by which a temperature record is broken say anything at all about a role ( or not ) of AGW in influencing a single local heat wave event ?\nWhile providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave event is critical for understanding the situation , the answer to each of these questions is \u2018 no.\n\u2019 A , C , E and F , in combination , would stack the deck in favor of a \u2018 yes \u2019 , but data does not provide a quantitative answer to how much warming from the heat wave was caused by AGW .\nGetting to an unequivocal \u2018 no \u2019 answer simply from analyzing the temperature record is more challenging .\nBut if a local heat wave record is set , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand the proximate ( weather ) causes and any underlying climate influence ( multi-decadal natural variability and/or AGW ) .\nAs described by Gavin Schmidt at RealClimate : https : //www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2021/07/rapid-attribution-of-pnw-heatwave/ # .YOYxqur28iM.twitter \u201c The way that climate-model based attribution for extreme events works ( as discussed previously on RealClimate here and here etc . )\nis that you look at the situation with and without the anthropogenic global warming signal and calculate the ratio of probabilities .\nIf an event is say , twice as common with the GW , then one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % to anthropogenic forcing and the return time is half what it used to be .\nIf it is five times more likely , the attribution is 80 % = 100* ( 5-1 ) /5 and the return time is a fifth of what it used to be .\nIn this case , we are seeing probability ratios of 150 to 1000s , suggesting that these , improbable , temperatures can be almost entirely attributed to global warming .\nWithout the anthropogenic signal , temperatures this extreme wouldn \u2019 t have happened in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d The rapid report from the European team is found [ here ] This report has gotten a lot of media attention , as an example see this article from Time .\nhttps : //time.com/6079744/climate-weather-attribution/ So , what \u2019 s wrong with this picture ?\n1 .\nA time series of order a hundred years ( from observations or a model simulation ) is insufficient to develop meaningful statistics about being a 1 in 10,000 year event .\n2 .\nThe atmospheric dynamics in global climate models are fairly \u2018 blah \u2019 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamentally unable to capture the kind of blocking events that causes heat waves , or resolve hurricanes , or resolve extreme convective events that cause flooding , etc .\n3 .\nThis approach implicitly assumes that all climate change is caused by emissions , and ignores or mischaracterizes multi-decadal natural internal variability ( since climate models do not have the correct phasing and amplitudes ) .\nCliff Mass has done a masterful job of critiquing the report from the European group .\nI don \u2019 t disagree with anything he says .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attribution is fundamentally flawed .\nUntil climate models are able actually resolve circulation features ( requiring a horizontal of resolution of ~20 km ) , they simply are not useful for attribution of extreme weather events .\nNOAA scientist Marty Hoerling has likened extreme weather event attribution to conducting an autopsy .\nYou have some clues , but the conclusion requires linking them together in a mechanistic sequence of events .\nCliff Mass has provided the best autopsy report so far on the heat wave .\nHe provides the follow summary of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat wave : \u201c Record amplitude of a ridge/high pressure over our region , forced by a tropical disturbance in the western Pacific , that produced a downstream wave train .\nAn environment that allowed the resulting wave to amplify .\nThe ridge had to be in exactly the right position relative to our terrain .\nAn upper-level trough had to develop in just the right location offshore and move in the optimal direction to cause strong southeasterly flow , fostering the supercharger noted above .\nWe needed a period when the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch without smoke , which has a profound cooling effect .\nThe meteorological dice had to come up all sixes .\nAnd they did.\n\u201d Process-based analyses are different from hand waving \u2018 story lines \u2019 .\nHere is what Mass considered : 1 .\nThe state of Washington has warmed by 1.5C over the past 120 years 2 .\nWhether the drought and dry soils contributed to the heat wave ( no , as per regional model simulations and the fact that there is no trend in drought in the Pacific northwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger ridges of high pressure ( no , as per data analysis and climate model simulations ) 5 .\nUse of regional climate model ( no , CO doesn \u2019 t produce more heat waves ) 6 .\nAnalysis of regional weather dynamics supported with regional climate modeling results shows a paradoxical pathway for cooling in the region So do we have an unambiguous \u2019 cause of death \u2019 here , i.e .\nan unambiguous \u2018 no \u2019 answer to the question as to whether AGW was the cause , or at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave ?\nA simple consilience of this evidence does not lead to an unambiguous \u2018 no \u2019 conclusion .\nHowever Cliff \u2019 s analysis is arguably sufficient to infer that CO was not the sole , or even dominant , cause of the record temperatures .\nWe need a better logic for attributing extreme weather events to global warming , and some outside-the-box thinking on how to attribute the causes of extreme weather events .\nConsidering the strategies described above , I and III are unsatisfactory , and frankly not at all useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of resources and brain power are wasted on this approach , for which global climate models , at their current resolution , are simply not fit-for-purpose .\nII is very useful , but the logic in evaluating this information for attribution is ambiguous .\nIV provides useful insights , but doesn \u2019 t provide a quantitative answer regarding attribution or a clear role of CO \u2018 s contribution .\nWe need a fifth way , that builds on II and IV , provides a better logic for conducting the autopsy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events can be extreme in terms of the magnitude of individual events , the frequency of events crossing some threshold , or clustering of extreme events .\nIt needs to be acknowledged that extreme events are by definition rare , and short historical records ( even century long records ) are insufficient for formulating meaningful statistics about return times .\nA thermodynamic and dynamical storyline of the extreme event needs to be assembled , similar to how Cliff Mass framed the problem .\nHere is an alternative approach for understanding and quantifying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe weather systems .\nThe example provided here is targeted at NW US heat wave .\nSingle column models of the atmosphere coupled to the land surface can provide a quantitative assessment of the direct contribution of CO forcing to the surface temperatures .\nThis is a better approach than looking at the historical record of annual average surface temperatures , and assuming that any increase is caused by CO and would increase the magnitude of any heat wave by that same amount .\nExperiment # 1 .\nFor this particular event , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking temperature , a local vertical profile of temperature and humidity can be obtained from a radiosonde or the operational analysis from numerical weather prediction centers .\nThis can be run through an atmospheric single-column model with radiative transfer model and land surface model to calculate the surface temperature in response to pre-industrial CO , current levels of CO , future levels of CO .\nThis is a simple calculation that answers the question : all other things being equal , how much difference have emissions for the past 100 years made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event that emerged , just through the radiative effects of the CO ?\nCold , dry situations with no clouds amplify the impact of CO on the surface temperature .\nIt is fairly easy to calculate exactly what effect the increase in CO would have on surface temperature under the local conditions for Portland , OR .\nWithout having done the calculation , an outcome of 1-3 F wouldn \u2019 t surprise me .\nExperiment # 2 .\nThis experiment builds on # 1 to address the impact of the fast thermodynamic feedbacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be accomplished by using the shape of the temperature profile and relative humidity from the original radiosonde or operational analysis to adjust the temperature and humidity profiles to the resulting surface temperature for the calculations in experiment # 1 for altered CO .\nThis provides a better assessment of the direct radiative effects of altered CO in this particular weather system .\nThe next set of experiments address the dynamical effects of increasing CO2 on the particular weather system that influenced the record high surface temperatures .\nThis heat wave was exceptionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in advance by global ensemble weather forecast system .\nGlobal ensemble weather forecast system with high resolution ( at least 20 km ) can be used to simulate the daily forecasts from 14 to 1 days in advance of the event , with a CO concentration of 300 ppm .\nNot clear at this point whether a single forecast simulation at each lead time is adequate , or whether the full ensemble is needed .\nExperiment # 3 .\nMake no change to the weather forecast model except to the CO concentration .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentration with the original forecasts : 500 and 850 mb geopotential heights and temperatures in the vicinity of the heat dome , also the surface temperatures in the NW US and SW Canada .\nIt may turn out that Experiment # 3 is sufficient to infer the role of more/less CO2 on the evolution of the omega block , heat dome and record high temperatures .\nBut experiments # 4 and # 5 should be considered , since there are caveats to interpreting experiment # 3 .\nExperiment # 4 .\nAlter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a way that preserves the global pattern of SST for this period , but have magnitudes more consistent with a 300 ppm climate .\nI would use NOAA \u2019 s 20th century reanalyses for this Subtract the annual average ( or summer average ) SST for each ocean grid point for a 300 ppm climate ( around 1910 ) from the current gridded values ; subtract the gridded difference from the SST field for this case used in the weather forecast models .\nRun the same set of experiments as in # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the reduced CO2 forecasts from # 3 .\nNote : not clear how quickly the initialized atmospheric temperature profiles will adjust to the altered SST , and how much this would influence the evolution of the atmospheric dynamics .\nExperiment # 5 .\nFor Experiment # 4 , the initialized atmospheric temperatures are too warm and specific humidity is too high relative to the lower SST values .\nHumidity initialization doesn \u2019 t really matter , since the model rapidly creates its own humidity field .\nHowever , the initial temperature field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that influence the circulations .\nDuring summer , the pole-to-equator temperature gradient wouldn \u2019 t change much between high and low CO ; melting Arctic sea ice would be just underway at the end of June in 1910 , whereas it is well underway in June in the current climate .\nConvective lapse rates would also be different for high vs low CO .\nI \u2019 m not sure how quickly the atmospheric temperatures would adjust to the altered SSTs in # 4 .\nInitialized atmospheric temperatures would be out of balance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marine atmosphere too stable .\nSomehow initializing with atmospheric temperatures more suited to 1910 while preserving all of the temperature gradients would be ideal .\nThe team doing the 20th century reanalyses could maybe figure out how to do this .\nWhat this set of numerical experiments would do is allow for inferences to be made that compare the thermodynamic and dynamical effects of reduced/increased CO on the surface temperatures and the dynamics of the heat dome .\nThe exact logic of how such inferences should be made , with what caveats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can give it here .\nSuch an analysis would only take us so far : the question remains as to whether increased CO is changing the overall hemispheric dynamics , making such heat dome events and omega blocks more or less frequent .\nExperiments with high-resolution ( 20 km horizontal resolution ) coupled global climate models with increased/decreased CO can provide some insights ( the essential ingredient is for the model to have sufficiently high resolution to resolve blocking patterns ) .\nAnalysis of global reanalysis data ( ERA5 back to 1950 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 19th century ) can provide some important insights : \u2022 Is increasing CO changing the multi-decadal ocean oscillations ?\nI \u2019 ve done a literature survey and there is no evidence of this yet .\n\u2022 Is additional warming changing ENSO ?\nI \u2019 ve done a literature survey and yes ENSO has changed since 1950 ; whether these changes are CO caused is debated .\n\u2022 Are the atmospheric teleconnection regimes ( e.g .\nAO , PNA etc ) changing ?\nThis is something I \u2019 ve looked at ( since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from minor variations associated with multi-decadal climate variability .\nWith regards to the wavy jet stream hypothesis and its influence on blocking , I follow the literature on this topic , but haven \u2019 t done a formal literature review on this .\nBasic dynamical reasoning does not support the wavy jet stream hypothesis .\nThere is more theoretical research to be done , and the ERA5 and 20th Century Reanalysis should prove a good data set for this , but the value lies in how these data are interpreted .\nAnd finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are increasingly being used for attribution analyses in a range of different fields .\nSo I \u2019 m tossing these ideas out for discussion , I look forward to your further outside-the-box ideas on how to approach this problem .\nAnd finally , I address the alarm over heat waves .\nI was in Utah in late June , where the local temperature reached 112F .\nIt is not pleasant .\nFortunately I could mostly stay inside where it was cooler .\nThere is no question that excessive and unusual heat causes health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot temperatures ( see this article about Pakistan ) .\nThis issue is unexpectedly hot temperatures , for which broad segments of the population are unprepared for and have no experience in dealing with .\nBy this standard , the record breaking temperatures in Portland were more difficult to deal with than the relative routine and substantially higher temperatures in Pakistan .\nWhile heat kills , cold temperatures kill more than an order of magnitude more people than heat .\nPat Michaels has been on this issue for decades , and its not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Guardian is interesting : Subtitle \u2013 \u201c More people died of cold than heat in past 20 years but climate change is shifting the balance.\n\u201d The only conclusion I can draw here is that global warming is associated with fewer temperature related deaths .\nWhich is completely at odds with the impression the Guardian article is trying to make with its alarming headline .", "author": "curryja", "url": "https://judithcurry.com/2021/07/15/heat-waves-and-hot-air/", "published": "Thu, 15 Jul 2021 18:27:39 +0000", "published_utc": 1626388059,

methodology on which they have long relied for attributing climate change to greenhouse gases is seriously flawed and its results are unreliable and largely meaningless .\nSome of the errors would be obvious to anyone trained in regression analysis , and the fact that they went unnoticed for 20 years despite the method being so heavily used does not reflect well on climatology as an empirical discipline .\nMy paper is a critique of \u201c Checking for model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allen and Simon Tett , which was published in Climate Dynamics in 1999 and to which I refer as AT99 .\nTheir attribution methodology was instantly embraced and promoted by the IPCC in the 2001 Third Assessment Report ( coincident with their embrace and promotion of the Mann hockey stick ) .\nThe IPCC promotion continues today : see AR6 Section 3.2.1 .\nIt has been used in dozens and possibly hundreds of studies over the years .\nWherever you begin in the Optimal Fingerprinting literature ( example ) , all paths lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Stott ( 2003 ) .\nSo its errors and deficiencies matter acutely .\nThe abstract of my paper reads as follows : \u201c Allen and Tett ( 1999 , herein AT99 ) introduced a Generalized Least Squares ( GLS ) regression methodology for decomposing patterns of climate change for attribution purposes and proposed the \u201c Residual Consistency Test \u201d ( RCT ) to check the GLS specification .\nTheir methodology has been widely used and highly influential ever since , in part because subsequent authors have relied upon their claim that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gauss-Markov ( GM ) Theorem , thereby yielding unbiased and efficient estimators .\nBut AT99 stated the GM Theorem incorrectly , omitting a critical condition altogether , their GLS method can not satisfy the GM conditions , and their variance estimator is inconsistent by construction .\nAdditionally , they did not formally state the null hypothesis of the RCT nor identify which of the GM conditions it tests , nor did they prove its distribution and critical values , rendering it uninformative as a specification test .\nThe continuing influence of AT99 two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrected .\nI identify 6 conditions needing to be shown for the AT99 method to be valid.\n\u201d The Allen and Tett paper had merit as an attempt to make operational some ideas emerging from an engineering ( signal processing ) paradigm for the purpose of analyzing climate data .\nThe errors they made come from being experts in one thing but not another , and the review process in both climate journals and IPCC reports is notorious for not involving people with relevant statistical expertise ( despite the reliance on statistical methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had refereed their paper 20 years ago the problems would have immediately been spotted , the methodology would have been heavily modified or abandoned and a lot of papers since then would probably never have been published ( or would have , but with different conclusions\u2014I suspect most would have failed to report \u201c attribution \u201d ) .\nAT99 made a number of contributions .\nThey took note of previous proposals for estimating the greenhouse \u201c signal \u201d in observed climate data and showed that they were equivalent to a statistical technique called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They then argued that , by construction , their GLS model satisfies the Gauss-Markov ( GM ) conditions , which according to an important theorem in statistics means it yields unbiased and efficient parameter estimates .\n( \u201c Unbiased \u201d means the expected value of an estimator equals the true value .\n\u201c Efficient \u201d means all the available sample information is used , so the estimator has the minimum variance possible . )\nIf an estimator satisfies the GM conditions , it is said to be \u201c BLUE \u201d \u2014the Best ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the best option out of the entire class of estimators that can be expressed as a linear function of the dependent variable .\nAT99 claimed that their estimator satisfies the GM conditions and therefore is BLUE , a claim repeated and relied upon subsequently by other authors in the field .\nThey also introduced a \u201c Residual Consistency \u201d ( RC ) test which they said could be used to assess the validity of the fingerprinting regression model .\nUnfortunately these claims are untrue .\nTheir method is not a conventional GLS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not , satisfy the GM conditions and in particular it violates an important condition for unbiasedness .\nAnd rejection or non-rejection of the RC test tells us nothing about whether the results of an optimal fingerprinting regression are valid .\nAT99 was heavily promoted in the 2001 IPCC Third Assessment Report ( TAR Chapter 12 , Box 12.1 , Section 12.4.3 and Appendix 12.1 ) and has been referenced in every IPCC Assessment Report since .\nTAR Appendix 12.1 was headlined \u201c Optimal Detection is Regression \u201d and began The detection technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimal detection \u201d studies performed to date has several equivalent representations ( Hegerl and North , 1997 ; Zwiers , 1999 ) .\nIt has recently been recognised that it can be cast as a multiple regression problem with respect to generalised least squares ( Allen and Tett , 1999 ; see also Hasselmann , 1993 , 1997 ) The growing level of confidence regarding attribution of climate change to GHG \u2019 s expressed by the IPCC and others over the past two decades rests principally on the many studies that employ the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe methodology is still in wide use , albeit with a couple of minor changes that don \u2019 t address the flaws identified in my critique .\n( Total Least Squares or TLS , for instance , introduces new

regression model needs to satisfy to be BLUE .\nThe first , called homoskedasticity , is that the error variances must be constant across the sample .\nThe second , called conditional independence , is that the expected values of the error terms must be independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fails , least squares coefficients will still be unbiased but their variance estimates will be biased .\nIf conditional independence fails , least squares coefficients and their variances will be biased and inconsistent , and the regression model output is unreliable .\n( \u201c Inconsistent \u201d means the coefficient distribution does not converge on the right answer even as the sample size goes to infinite . )\nI teach the GM theorem every year in introductory econometrics .\n( As an aside , that means I am aware of the ways I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refer to the paper and its sources for the formal version ) .\nIt comes up near the beginning of an introductory course in regression analysis .\nIt is not an obscure or advanced concept , it is the foundation of regression modeling techniques .\nMuch of econometrics consists of testing for and remedying violations of the GM conditions .\n( It is not essential to understand this paragraph , but it helps for what follows . )\nOptimal Fingerprinting works by regressing observed climate data onto simulated analogues from climate models which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forcings .\nThe regression coefficients thus provide the basis for causal inference regarding the forcing , and estimation of the magnitude of each factor \u2019 s influence .\nAuthors prior to AT99 argued that failure of the homoskedasticity condition might thwart signal detection , so they proposed transforming the observations by premultiplying them by a matrix P which is constructed as the matrix root of the inverse of a \u201c climate noise \u201d matrix C , itself computed using the covariances from preindustrial control runs of climate models .\nBut because C is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not exist , so P can instead be computed using a Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse , selecting a rank which in practice is far smaller than the number of observations in the regression model itself .\nAT99 asserted that the signal detection regression model applying the P matrix weights is homoscedastic by construction , therefore it satisfies the GM conditions , therefore its estimates are unbiased and efficient ( BLUE ) .\nEven if their model yields homoscedastic errors ( which is not guaranteed ) their statement is obviously incorrect : they left out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor\u2014as far as I have seen\u2014anyone in the climate detection field has ever mentioned the conditional independence assumption nor discussed how to test it nor the consequences should it fail .\nAnd fail it does\u2014routinely in regression modeling ; and when it fails the results can be spectacularly wrong , including wrong signs and meaningless magnitudes .\nBut you won \u2019 t know that unless you test for specific violations .\nIn the first version of my paper ( written in summer 2019 ) I criticized the AT99 derivation and then ran a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 different climate models and showed they routinely fail standard conditional independence tests .\nAnd when I implemented some standard remedies , the greenhouse gas signal was no longer detectable .\nI sent that draft to Allen and Tett in late summer 2019 and asked for their comments , which they undertook to provide .\nBut hearing none after several months I submitted it to the Journal of Climate , requesting Allen and Tett be asked to review it .\nTett provided a constructive ( signed ) review , as did two other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly an econometrician ( another might have been Allen but it was anonymous so I don \u2019 t know ) .\nAfter several rounds the paper was rejected .\nAlthough Tett and the econometrician supported publication the other reviewer and the editor did not like my proposed alternative methodology .\nBut none of the reviewers disputed my critique of AT99 \u2019 s handling of the GM theorem .\nSo I carved that part out and sent it in winter 2021 to Climate Dynamics , which accepted it after 3 rounds of review .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are necessary for the AT99 model to yield BLUE coefficients , not all of which AT99 stated .\nAll 5 fail by construction .\nI also list 6 conditions that need to be proven for the AT99 method to be valid .\nIn the absence of such proofs there is no basis for claiming the results of the AT99 method are unbiased or consistent , and the results of the AT99 method ( including use of the RC test ) should not be considered reliable as regards the effect of GHG \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I make is that the assumption that an estimator of C provides a valid estimate of the error covariances means the AT99 method can not be used to test a null hypothesis that greenhouse gases have no effect on the climate .\nWhy not ?\nBecause an elementary principle of hypothesis testing is that the distribution of a test statistic under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true can not be conditional on the null hypothesis being false .\nThe use of a climate model to generate the homoscedasticity weights requires the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true representation of climate processes and dynamics .\nThe climate model embeds the assumption that greenhouse gases have a significant climate impact .\nOr , equivalently , that natural processes alone can not generate a large class of observed events in the climate , whereas greenhouse gases can .\nIt is therefore not possible to use the climate model-generated weights to construct a test of the assumption that natural processes alone could generate the class of observed events in the climate .\nAnother less-obvious problem is the assumption that use of the Moore-Penrose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result satisfies the GM conditions .\nBut the reduction of rank of the resulting covariance matrix estimator means it is biased and inconsistent and the GM conditions automatically fail .\nAs I explain in the paper , there is a simple and well-known alternative to using P matrix weights\u2014use of White \u2019 s ( 1980 ) heteroskedasticity-consistent covariance matrix estimator , which has long been known to yield consistent variance estimates .\nIt was already 20 years old and in use everywhere ( other than climatology apparently ) by the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a method that is much harder to use and yields biased and inconsistent results .\nAT99 claimed that a test statistic formed using the signal detection regression residuals and the C matrix from an independent climate model follows a centered chi-squared distribution , and if such a test score is small relative to the 95 % chi-squared critical value , the model is validated .\nMore specifically , the null hypothesis is not rejected .\nBut what is the null hypothesis ?\nAstonishingly it was never written out mathematically in the paper .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of statements about noise patterns , ending with a far-reaching claim that if the test doesn \u2019 t reject , \u201c then we have no explicit reason to distrust uncertainty estimates based on our analysis.\n\u201d As a result , researchers have treated the RC test as encompassing every possible specification error , including ones that have no rational connection to it , erroneously treating non-rejection as comprehensive validation of the signal detection regression model specification .\nThis is incomprehensible to me .\nIf in 1999 someone had submitted a paper to even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test in the way that AT99 did , it would have been annihilated at review .\nThey didn \u2019 t state the null hypothesis mathematically or list the assumptions necessary to prove its distribution ( even asymptotically , let alone exactly ) , they provided no analysis of its power against alternatives nor did they state any alternative hypotheses in any form so readers have no idea what rejection or non-rejection implies .\nSpecifically , they established no link between the RC test and the GM conditions .\nI provide in the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the AT99 model might be biased and inconsistent by construction , yet the RC test would never reject .\nAnd supposing that the RC test does reject , which GM condition therefore fails ?\nNothing in their paper explains that .\nIt \u2019 s the only specification test used in the fingerprinting literature and it is utterly meaningless .\nWhen I submitted my paper to CD I asked that Allen and Tett be given a chance to provide a reply which would be reviewed along with it .\nAs far as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my paper was reviewed in isolation .\nWhen I was notified of its acceptance in late July I sent them a copy with an offer to delay publication until they had a chance to prepare a response , if they wished to do so .\nI did not hear back from either of them so I proceeded to edit and approve the proofs .\nI then wrote them again , offering to delay further if they wanted to produce a reply .\nThis time Tett wrote back with some supportive comments about my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go ahead and publish my comment .\nI hope they will provide a response at some point , but in the meantime my critique has passed peer review and is unchallenged .\n1 .\nYes but look at all the papers over the years that have successfully applied the AT99 method and detected a role for GHGs .\nAnswer : the fact that a flawed methodology is used hundreds of times does not make the methodology reliable , it just means a lot of flawed results have been published .\nAnd the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people working in the signal detection/Optimal Fingerprinting literature aren \u2019 t well-trained in GLS methods .\nPeople have assumed , falsely , that the AT99 method yields \u201c BLUE \u201d \u2013 i.e .\nunbiased and efficient \u2013 estimates .\nMaybe some of the past results were correct .\nThe problem is that the basis on which people said so is invalid , so no one knows .\n2 .\nYes but people have used other methods that also detect a causal role for greenhouse gases .\nAnswer : I know .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those methods are weaker as regards proving causality , and they rely even more explicitly on the assumption that climate models are perfect .\nAnd the methods based on time series analysis have not adequately grappled with the problem of mismatched integration orders between forcings and observed temperatures .\nI have some new coauthored work on this in process .\n3 .\nYes but this is just theoretical nitpicking , and I haven \u2019 t proven the previously-published results are false .\nAnswer : What I have proven is that the basis for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correctly highlighted the importance of the GM theorem but messed up its application .\nIn other work ( which will appear in due course ) I have found that common signal detection results , even in recent data sets , don \u2019 t survive remedying the failures of the GM conditions .\nIf anyone thinks my arguments are mere nitpicking and believes the AT99 method is fundamentally sound , I have listed the six conditions needing to be proven to support such a claim .\nGood luck .\nI am aware that AT99 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2003 ) which proposed TLS for handling errors-in-variables .\nThis doesn \u2019 t alleviate any of the problems I have raised herein .\nAnd in a separate paper I argue that TLS over-corrects , imparting an upward bias as well as causing severe inefficiency .\nI am presenting a paper at this year \u2019 s climate econometrics conference discussing these results .\nThe AR6 Summary paragraph A.1 upgrades IPCC confidence in attribution to \u201c Unequivocal \u201d and the press release boasts of \u201c major advances in the science of attribution.\n\u201d In reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the climatology profession has been oblivious to the errors in AT99 , and untroubled by the complete absence of specification testing in the subsequent fingerprinting literature .\nThese problems mean there is no basis for treating past attribution results based on the AT99 method as robust or valid .\nThe conclusions might by chance have been correct , or totally inaccurate ; but without correcting the methodology and applying standard tests for failures of the GM conditions it is mere conjecture to say more than that .", "author": "curryja", "url": "https://judithcurry.com/2021/08/18/the-ipccs-attribution-methodology-is-fundamentally-flawed/", "published": "Wed, 18 Aug 2021

"content": "In a recent invited talk at the American Chemical Society annual meeting , I attempted to explain the climate debate in 15 minutes .\nThis talk was given in a session on sustainability .\nOther invited speakers included James Green ( NASA Chief Scientist ) , Marilyn Brown ( Georgia Tech ) .\nOur talks were followed by a panel discussion .\nThis was an extremely interesting session , but was not recorded owing to an ACS glitch ( you can read the abstracts at the link above ) .\nMy presentation slides can be downloaded [ here ] .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ editor , no idea how the ppt file will show up .\nBelow is the text of my remarks .\nThe climate crisis can be summarized as : \u2022 The warming is caused by us \u2022 We need to urgently transition to renewable energy to stop the warming \u2022 Once we stop burning fossil fuels , sea level rise will stop and the weather won \u2019 t be so extreme A few weeks ago , the Intergovernmetal Panel on Climate Change , or IPCC , issued its 6th Assessment report .\nIn response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated that In my talk today , I \u2019 m going to present you with a different perspective on the climate change problem and how we can approach solutions .\nSo what \u2019 s wrong with the crisis narrative ?\nIt is my assessment that \u2022 We \u2019 ve vastly oversimplified both the problem and its solutions \u2022 The complexity and uncertainty surrounding climate change is being kept away from the public and policy debates .\n\u2022 Rapid reductions in emissions are technologically and politically infeasible on a global scale \u2022 And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ societal problems , distracting from real solutions to them .\nEven people that don \u2019 t know much about climate science have heard that 97 % of climate scientists agree .\nBut exactly what do they agree on ?\nNot nearly as much as is portrayed in the media .\nEveryone agrees that : \u2022 Humans are adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere , and \u2022 Carbon Dioxide and other greenhouse gases have a warming effect on the planet However , there is disagreement on the most consequential issues : \u2022 How much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by humans \u2022 How much the planet will warm in the 21st century \u2022 And how we should respond to the warming , to improve human well being For policy making , the most consequential issue is how much warming we can expect in the 21st century .\nThis figure from the latest IPCC report shows climate model simulations of global surface temperature anomalies over the 21st century .\nThere \u2019 s a large range of warming shown in this diagram , from 1.5 to more than 4 degrees centigrade above pre-industrial temperatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 1 degree centigrade , so whether the future warming is on the low or high end has huge implications for climate policy .\nThe largest amount of warming is associated with an extreme emissions scenario , SSP-8.5 .\nThese simulations should not be regarded as predictions for the following reasons : \u2022 First , and most importantly , the IPCC does not include future scenarios of natural climate variability .\nThese include solar variability , volcanic eruptions and multi-decadal ocean circulation patterns .\n\u2022 Second , the IPCC does not assess the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are two primary factors that contribute to this large range of temperatures for the 21st century .\nThe first is the emissions scenarios , which determine how much CO2 is added to the atmosphere , these are indicated by the SSPs .\nThe second factor is the sensitivity of warming to a given amount of added CO2 .\nOn the previous slide , recall that the largest amount of warming was associated with the emissions scenario SSP-8.5 .\nThe IPCC 5th Assessment Report regarded the 8.5 scenario to be our most likely future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business-as-usual scenario .\nHowever , its becoming increasingly apparent that the 8.5 scenarios are implausibly high .\nThe two lines at the bottom of this figure show projections of emissions made by the International Energy Agency out to 2040 .\nThe higher projection shows the expected emissions based on current policies , and the lower projection is based on current commitments under the Paris Agreement .\nBoth of these show fairly steady emissions through 2040 , that are much lower than the 8.5 scenarios .\nNevertheless , the most recent IPCC report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this extreme emissions scenario is the source of alarming impacts .\nThe second major source of uncertainty is the sensitivity of the global temperatures to a doubling of CO2 .\nFor decades , the likely range for climate sensitivity has been between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees centigrade , which is reflected by the assessment from the IPCC AR5 published in 2013 .\nThe red bars in this figure shows the range of climate sensitivity from the most recent climate model simulations .\nThe sensitivity values range from 1.8 to 5.7 degrees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the AR5 , whose highest value was 4.6 degrees The IPCC AR6 substantially narrowed the likely range of climate sensitivity to between 2.5 and 4 degrees , rejecting the highest values from the climate models .\nHowever this narrowing of the range is disputed , particularly on the low end .\nThe whole issue of climate sensitivity to CO2 remains unsettled , with a high level of uncertainty .\nThe bottom line here is some good news .\nThe extreme tail risks from global warming , associated with very high emissions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now regarded as unlikely if not implausible .\nThe next area of disagreement takes us away from science and into the realm of values .\nHow dangerous is global warming ?\nThe IPCC 5th Assessment Report used a burning embers diagram to portray reasons for concern .\nThe level of concern increases with the amount of global warming .\nNote that the IPCC does not use the words \u2018 dangerous \u2019 , \u2018 crisis \u2019 or \u2018 catastrophe \u2019 in its report ; rather it uses \u2018 reasons for concern.\n\u2019 Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Goldilocks principle .\nExactly which climate state is too hot versus too cold ?\nSome answer this question by stating that the climate we \u2019 re adapted to is \u2018 just right \u2019 .\nHowever , the IPCC uses a preindustrial baseline , in the late 1700 \u2019 s .\nWhy anyone thinks that this is an ideal climate is beyond me .\nThis was during the Little Ice Age , the coldest period of the millennia .\nThink George Washington and the horrible winters at Valley forge .\nWhile the categories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem a bit nebulous , the 6th assessment report focused on extreme weather and climate events .\nLets take a look .\nThe recent IPCC report did not detect any global trends in flooding , meteorological or hydrological drought , winter storms or tornadoes .\nTrends were identified in heat waves , heavy rainfall events and fire weather .\nThe report concluded that it is likely that the global proportion of major hurricanes has increased over the last four decades .\nGlobal hurricane data supports this conclusion .\nHowever , there \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurricane activity .\nThe diagram on the left shows the number of major hurricanes that have struck the U.S. since 1900 .\nThe year 2005 stands out as the highest , which was followed by a period of 11 years with no major hurricane landfalls .\nAlso , there were a large number of major hurricane landfalls during the first half of the 20th century , when surface temperatures were significantly cooler The large amount of natural variability makes it difficult to identify meaningful trends , and even more difficult to attribute any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right hand side shows US heat waves , which have been the big climate story this past summer .\nAs the global average temperature increases , it makes sense that heat extremes would increase and cold extremes would decrease .\nHowever , reality isn \u2019 t so simple .\nThis figure from the EPA shows that heat waves in the 1930 \u2019 s were horrendous and much worse than in recent decades , even though the average global temperature was significantly lower in the 1930 \u2019 s .\nAn important issue is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies have found that there are more deaths from cold events than from heat events , by as much as an order of magnitude .\nThe inescapable conclusion is that more warming leads to fewer deaths from temperature extremes .\nSo which would Goldilocks prefer ?\nSo far , the world has done a decent job at adapting to weather extremes climate change .\nThe upper left figure shows the change in yield for major crops , with yields for many crops doubling or even quadrupling since 1960 .\nThe figure in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disasters as a percent of GDP .\nThe spikes are associated with years that showed large losses from tropical cyclones .\nOverall for the past 30 years , there has actually been a slight decline in losses .\nThe diagram in the lower right shows the number of deaths per million people from weather and climate catastrophes .\nThe large numbers early in the 20th century were mostly associated with tropical cyclone landfalls in south Asia .\nOver the past century , climate related deaths have dropped 97 % .\nUnder the auspices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Change , the world is attempting to reach netzero in carbon emissions by 2050 .\nI refer to this as Plan A .\nUsing the precautionary principle , Plan A is based on the premise that rapidly reducing CO2 emissions is critical for preventing future dangerous warming of the climate .\nThe other side of the policy debate rejects the urgency of reducing emissions .\nThey argue that any near term reduction in warming would be minimal and at high cost .\nAn effective strategy requires global reduction in emissions , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue that its best to focus on keeping economies strong and making sure that everyone has access to energy .\nAnd finally , the argument is made that there are other more pressing problems than climate change that need to be addressed with the available resources .\nIn spite of the numerous UN treaties and agreements to reduce emissions , the atmospheric CO2 concentration relentlessly continues to increase The challenge to getting to netzero by 2050 is illustrated by this diagram from the International Energy Agency .\nThis figure shows the pathways for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take to reach netzero by 2050 .\nEurope and the US have already turned the corner , but they still have a very steep path to netzero .\nBy 2050 , global emissions will be dominated by whatever China and India have done , or have failed to do .\nThe IEA roadmap finds that there is a possible but very narrow pathway to netzero by 2050 , provided that there \u2019 s a huge leap in energy innovation and major efforts to build new infrastructure .\nOthers find that reaching netzero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossibility .\nHow did we come to the point where we \u2019 re alleged to have a future crisis on our hands , but the primary solution of rapid global emissions reductions is deemed to be impossible ?\nThe source of this conundrum is that we have mischaracterized climate change as a tame problem , with a simple solution .\nClimate change is better characterized as a wicked mess .\nA wicked problem is complex with dimensions that are difficult to define and changing with time .\nA mess is characterized by resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that create additional problems .\nIn decision making , a problem is associated with deep uncertainty if prediction models are inadequate , there is heavy reliance on subjective judgment , and there is disagreement on desirable alternative outcomes .\nFor such situations , treating a problem as if its tame can result in a situation where the cure is not only ineffective , but worse than the disease .\nWe clearly need a Plan B , that broadens the climate policy envelope .\nBy considering climate change as a wicked mess , climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for actively reimagining human life .\nSuch a narrative can expand our imaginative capacity and animate political action while managing social losses .\nHere \u2019 s a framework for how we can get to a Plan B .\nIn addressing the climate change problem , we need to remind ourselves that climate isn \u2019 t an end in itself , and that climate change isn \u2019 t the only problem that the world is facing .\nThe objective should be to improve human wellbeing in the 21st century , while protecting the environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision making that focuses on food , energy , water and ecosystems will support human wellbeing in the coming decades .\nWe need to recognize that how the climate of the 21st century will play out is a topic of deep uncertainty .\nOnce natural climate variability is accounted for , it may turn out to be relatively benign .\nOr we may be faced with unanticipated surprises .\nAlarmism about climate change misleads us and panic makes us less likely to tackle climate change smartly .\nA more pragmatic approach to dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emissions targets , in favor of accelerating energy innovation .\nWhether or not we manage to drastically curtail our carbon dioxide emissions in the coming decades , we need to reduce our vulnerability to extreme weather and climate events .\nSo what does a plan B look like ?\nLocal solutions that secure the common interest can avoid political gridlock .\nThere are a lot of relatively small things that we can do to reduce atmospheric CO2 and other greenhouse gases , that have justifications independent of climate mitigation .\nIndividual countries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their local environmental problems and climate-related risks .\nProgress can be made on a number of fronts related to land use , forest management , agriculture , water resource management , waste management , among many others .\nHuman wellbeing will be improved as a result of these efforts , whether or not climate change turns out to be a huge problem and whether or not we manage to drastically reduce our emissions .\nEncroachment of politics into socially-relevant science is unavoidable .\nProblems arise from many sources , and scientists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culpable .\nThe issue of greatest concern to me is when scientists filter research results and their public statements of facts with an eye to downstream political use .\nGovernments exacerbate this by funding a narrow range of projects that support their preferred policies .\nClimate science is far from the only area of science that has been politicized .\nOthers include COVID19 , gender studies , genetically modified food .\nCancel culture is alive and well in the sciences , where scientists that disagree with an interpretation that supports desired policy objectives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their jobs .\nIn conclusion , a personal statement .\nI regard my job as a scientist to critically evaluate evidence and to challenge and reassess conclusions drawn from the evidence .\nWhile I regard manmade climate change as a cause for concern , I do not view this as a crisis or an apocalypse .\nThis perspective has placed me at odds with the activist branch of the climate science community , who regard my perspective as inconvenient .\nThe academic political pressures from activist scientists and even politicians caused me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI \u2019 m now working in the private sector , helping businesses to understand and manage their weather and climate related risks .\nI am also active in engaging with policy makers and the public .\nI have a blog Climate Etc .\nthat provides a forum for scientists and the interested public to engage in discussion on topics related to climate science and the science-policy interface .\nWell its been awhile since I \u2019 ve had an invited talk in a mainstream academic venue .\n15 minutes is longer than 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of territory to cover .\nThis is the first thing I \u2019 ve written publicly on the IPCC AR6 .\nI have been crazy busy for months , currently exacerbated by hurricanes .\nI do have some material in the pipeline for blog posts , i will try hard not to let two weeks pass between posts .", "author": "curryja", "url": "https://judithcurry.com/2021/09/03/15-minutes/", "published": "Sat, 04 Sep 2021 01:03:00 +0000", "published_utc": 1630731780,

"A microcosm on the \u2018 morality \u2019 of cancel culture : the aborted conference on \u2018 Global Warming : Mitigation Strategies \u2019 , hosted by the Italian scientific academy the Lincei .\nMy essay \u2018 What is the harm in forecasting catastrophe due to man-made global warming ?\n\u2019 [ link ] placed the debate about human influences on the climate in the context of a larger process of polarization common when scientific disagreements become public .\nAs described by sociologist of science Robert K. Merton [ link ] , each group then responds to stereotyped versions of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s work primarily what the hostile stereotype has alerted them to see , and then promptly mistake the part for the whole .\nIn this process , each group \u2026 becomes less and less motivated to study the work of the other , since there is manifestly little point in doing so .\nThey scan the out-group \u2019 s writings just enough to find ammunition for new fusillades.\n\u201c Karl Popper \u2019 s epistemological basis for knowledge \u2013 knowledge advances by disconfirmation \u2014 goes out the window , for the birds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true becomes a function of their group identity .\nSee also Anne Applebaum , \u2018 The New Puritans \u2019 , recently published in The Atlantic .\nThe result is what I call a \u2018 syndrome of exaggeration \u2019 : each side is inclined to exaggerate evidence in its favour and downplay evidence against , which justifies the other in exaggerating evidence in its favour and downplaying evidence against ; and back again .\nIt is a syndrome in that the behaviour of each side confirms the negative expectations of the other .\nMembers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ad hominem , like adolescent school boys , including people who regard themselves as serious scientists .\nIn the digital era members are able to quickly find each another and the enemy , and communicate without editing .\nGlobal warming and climate change provides fertile ground for these social processes , not least because many scientists , journalists , activists and others regard global warming as the impending catastrophe , the existential threat to humanity and life on Earth , and see it as their supreme duty to warn humanity and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , locally ; while a small but vociferous set of scientists and others believe that to be a big exaggeration .\nAmped up through the syndrome of exaggeration , each side becomes predisposed to draw conclusions on individual issues ( eg extreme weather ) less from the evidence of those individual issues and more from packaged-up ideological visions , the better to maintain clear moral battle lines ; disagreement becomes moral heresy .\nUnfortunately , the Merton polarization dynamics tend to squeeze out non-polemical consideration of intermediate arguments .\nIn contemporary terminology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture \u2019 , defined in Wikipedia as \u2018 a modern form of ostracism in which someone is thrust out of social or professional circles \u2026 a form of boycotting or shunning involving an individual \u2026 who is deemed to have acted or spoken in a questionable or controversial manner \u2019 .\nIn climate change , the dominant side , by far , is the side which says that the \u2018 catastrophe \u2019 scenario of humanity \u2019 s future is likely enough that we must use it to mount major changes in public and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 behavior all around the world over the next several decades , with the overriding aim to reach \u2018 net zero by 2050 \u2019 .\nAlmost all the attention for avoiding catastrophe is on cutting emissions so as to minimize global warming ; questions of adapting to climate change are confined to the margins .\nThis side \u2019 s members commonly embrace the morality of cancel culture when it comes to those whom they call \u2018 deniers \u2019 , regardless of scientific qualifications .\nRecently I read on Climate Etc .\n( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) \u2018 A climate of dialogue \u2019 , a pacated dialogue between two scientists who have rather different approaches to issues of climate change .\n( \u2018 Pacated \u2019 means to make less hostile , peaceful \u2014 an unfamiliar word that deserves wide currency in these polarized times . )\nOne of them was Andrea Saltelli .\nThrough him I learnt of a conference that was to be hosted by the main and oldest Italian scientific academy , Academia Nazionale dei Lincei , titled \u2018 Global warming : mitigation strategies \u2019 , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saltelli was to be one of the speakers .\nBut then the Lincei cancelled it , without official explanation .\nUnofficially the reason was the backlash from invited participants at the inclusion of a paper ( one of 14 papers ) challenging the evidence given in support of the hypothesis that current global warming is caused almost entirely by human activities .\nOne of its seven co-authors ( among whom were climatologists and physicists ) was a professor of physical chemistry and reputed \u201c denier \u201d .\nThrough Saltelli I contacted Dr Monica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioning the wisdom of cancelling the conference , published in an Italian academic discussion journal .\nWith her help I reconstructed the following account of cancel culture in action .\nFrom many submissions ( all by scientists ) , a host committee of four selected 14 papers to be presented .\nOne of the papers had seven authors , including climatologists and physicists .\nThe paper , \u2018 Critical considerations regarding the anthropogenic global warming theory \u2019 , took issue with the argument that current global warming is due almost entirely to human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of evidence given in support of the hypothesis is insufficient to confirm it .\nIts thrust was in line with the Popperian principle of falsification as the route to get closer to the truth .\nThe newspaper Repubblica ran a story ( 18 September 2019 ) focused on the fact that one of the seven authors of this paper , Franco Battaglia , had not published about climate in peer review journals ( he is professor physical chemistry at the University of Modena ) .\nRepubblica said that the Lincei was lowering its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denier \u2019 Battaglia as a co-author .\nThe Lincei sent a short article to Repubblica explaining the reason for the conference and the inclusion of this paper , which Repubblica refused to publish .\nWhen some intending participating scientists read the Repubblica article , they disinvited themselves on account of not wanting to be in any way associated with Battaglia and his ( and six co-authors \u2019 ) argument .\nSome also said that the question of \u2018 attribution \u2019 ( the extent to which global warming is due to human causes ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on mitigation strategies , and should not be included in the program .\nSome also affirmed that there is simply no room for doubt \u2013 all reputable scientists accept that current global warming is due almost entirely to human action , so it would be a waste of everyone \u2019 s time to hear the paper ( as though it was arguing that the earth is flat ) .\nNone had seen the disputed paper .\nIn response to the hostile Repubblica article and the wave of protest from intending participants , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 informing only the participants , giving no public notice .\nLater ( 30 September 2019 ) , Repubblica published an article titled \u2018 Clima , la fronda degli scienziati italiani che negano la scienza \u2019 ( \u2018 Climate , the fringe of Italian scientists who deny the science \u2019 ) , about the petition signed by over 145 scientists supporting the legitimacy of challenging the man-made global warming hypothesis , where it mentioned the cancelled conference .\nMonica Di Fiore ( National Research Council ) published an essay in ROARS , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 March 2020 , titled \u2018 Il silenzio dei Lincei .\nCui prodest ?\n\u2019 ( \u2018 The silence of the Lincei .\nWho benefits ?\n\u2019 ) , in which she questioned the wisdom of cancelling the event .\nHer essay attracted 24 comments .\nThe large majority supported the Lincei \u2019 s decision , and the large majority were expressed in polemical , ad hominem language , with little or no engagement with either the argument of the paper or the ethics of the Lincei \u2019 s decision .\nWhat could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole conference in order to prevent discussion of one out of 14 papers , one of whose seven co-authors was a reputed \u201c denier \u201d ?\nNotice the title of Repubblica \u2019 s article , \u2018 Climate , the fringe of Italian scientists who deny the science \u2019 .\nThis converts \u2018 the science \u2019 , as an approach to knowledge , into The Science , a body of knowledge with the status of Revealed Truth .\nCancellation of the Lincei conference on mitigation strategies is a microcosm of the morality of cancel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was canceled to prevent the presentation of a paper questioning whether full-on mitigation \u2014 big cuts in carbon emissions \u2014 is imperative to save humanity ; and to block the voice of an outspoken \u2018 denier \u2019 ( a professor of physical chemistry ) .\nThe fate of the conference illustrates the danger that the Merton dynamics in global warming focus the attention of scientists and science on the fight against the other and away from dispassionate analysis and assessment of the goodness or otherwise of models , data and mechanisms .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can not be treated simply as reflexes of climate change , including collapse of insect populations and fisheries , atmospheric pollution , plastic pollution , endocrine disruptors , and several others of global scale \u2013 issues which are relegated to second- or third-order , once it is accepted as true beyond doubt that humanity is on the path to catastrophe unless we reach net zero by 2050 or maybe 2075 .\nMeanwhile , we the global public have to realize how useful the \u2018 climate emergency \u2019 is for political leaders to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to \u2013 and divert attention from more awkward topics .\nImagine the relief of the G7 heads of government meeting in Biarritz , August 2019 : their officials had prepared the way for a G7 discussion of how to make capitalism \u2018 fairer \u2019 and reduce income and wealth inequality , but the heads of government gratefully let the discussion of climate , with its class-free and more distant horizons , marginalize how to create a fairer capitalism .\nMore than this , the Lincei case illustrates the dangers of scientists blurring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more political task to \u2018 persuade \u2019 .\nAs informers they are morally obliged to follow Einstein \u2019 s dictum : \u2018 The right to search for truth implies also a duty ; one must not conceal any part of what one has recognized to be true \u2019 .\nAs persuaders they are not , and their incentives too easily produce Merton polarization dynamics with sharp lines between \u2018 them \u2019 and \u2018 us \u2019 , between \u2018 heresy \u2019 and \u2018 Truth \u2019 .\nThe public should be beware that evidence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only by \u2018 the science \u2019 .\nSeveral friends who read this essay in draft and my long essay cited cited above have been upset by them and implicitly or explicitly urged me not to publish , because they give succour to the \u2018 deniers \u2019 .\nOne , a highly respected investigative journalist based in London , wrote : \u201c you are in the very dubious company of climate deniers .\nI am just wondering Robert , where you got your material .\nDid you find this all yourself \u2013 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nNo , you don \u2019 t need to give me an answer but you should ask yourself what you are doing and how you are doing it .\nAnd ultimately , whose fight you are fighting.\n\u201d I am struck that people ( westerners ) advocating fast exit from fossil fuels seem to be little aware of the situation of the large majority of the populations of developing countries ; little aware of global energy demand as population in developing countries rises and standards of living rise ( especially Africa ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ from today \u2019 s 80 % of global energy from fossil fuels to 2050 \u2019 s near zero , as though by magic ; or else that \u2018 Africa and large parts of the rest of the developing world have to remain poor , their total energy use limited to renewables , because continued use of fossil fuels brings \u2013 we know \u2014 the ruin of humanity \u2019 .\nAbout the author : Robert H Wade is Professor of Global Political Economy , London School of Economics",

"content": "A critique of Judah Cohen \u2019 s recent cover article in Science linking February \u2019 s disastrous cold outbreak in Texas to global warming I \u2019 ve always had trouble with the notion that warming causes cooling .\nIt leaves me with the squeasy feeling I get when my country neighbors insist that putting hot water in the ice cube tray results in quicker ice cubes .\nThat \u2019 s actually an experiment you can run , and I can assure that it most certainly does not ( despite the arguments that are likely to follow in the comments section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder to run a similar experiment on , say , the hypothesis that an anomalous and costly ( $ 200 billion ) cold outbreak in Texas last February was caused by global warming .\nLeaving out that much of the damage had to do with remarkably unprotected generation equipment\u2014both conventional and renewable\u2014it was very cold and windy , even by Texas blue norther standards .\nYou just can \u2019 t stick a slightly warmer Texas in the fridge to see if it now freezes faster .\nPredictably , champions of the warming-causes-cold-anomalies have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a consulting atmospheric scientist , with his theory that sea-ice changes in the arctic and snow-driven October changes in Siberia conspire to stretch the stratospheric polar vortex down to , say , Texas .\nSomehow his stuff always makes it into The New York Times , which is likely not a measure of its quality , but rather yet another thing to turn on their climate change alarm ( which it rarely turns off ) .\n\u201c Therefore , Arctic change is likely contributing to the increasing of SPV [ Stratospheric Polar Vortex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to the Texas cold wave of February 2021.\n\u201d How he reached this conclusion is a conventional story .\nFirst , break down some target variable ( in this case,100mb-heights ) into characteristic patterns , and then use a General Circulation Model ( GCM ) to explain its behavior .\nWhile Cohen and his four coauthors said the patterns were from \u201c a machine learning technique \u201d , it was actually good old-fashioned cluster analysis , something that has been around physical geography since the ice age .\nGuess what .\nAmplitudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , others are going down and , 40 % have no statistically significant changes .\nCohen then correlated these changes to October Eurasian snow cover .\nGiven that Cohen has had some success in correlating October Siberian snow amount and geographic advance across with cold outbreaks into the U.S. ( along with reductions in ice cover in the Arctic Ocean ) , he sought to \u201c prove \u201d the relationship with \u201c a simplified GCM\u2026well suited for isolating the atmospheric response to idealized heating perturbations \u201d .\nThe model is acronymed MiMA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atmosphere .\nThe word idealized isn \u2019 t defined , nor is the related reasoning , so we have to consult Chaim Garfinkel , the fourth author of the Cohen paper , and the first author of a paper describing MiMA , where we find out that it \u2019 s \u201c idealized \u201d because the extant GCMs are \u201c tuned \u201d so much that they become unstable : \u201c These comprehensive [ general circulation ] models , however , tend to be less flexible and tuned such that removing too many relevant forcings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess as to what \u2019 s \u201c tuned \u201d in the GCMs that leads to unstable behavior might be what \u2019 s left out of MiMA \u2013 it has no clouds .\nThe albedo ( think of \u201c reflectivity \u201d ) of clouds exerts a net cooling particularly over latitudes away from the tropics .\nMiMA artificially decreases the earth \u2019 s albedo because of its lack of clouds , from constant 27 % down to about a constant 20 % ( in reality it is never constant ) , which represents a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heating the earth \u2019 s surface .\nSo , to this simulated climate , Cohen et al .\nchange ( raise ) the albedo of Siberia and east Asia in the early fall , to compensate for an increase in October snow cover that has been detected since 1979 , as well as raise the temperature of the model \u2019 s Arctic Ocean to get it to lose more ice .\nAnd , presto-chango , the modified model stretches its wintertime polar stratospheric vortex to somehow get to Texas in February 2021 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that makes money by selling in-advance winter forecasts .\nJust think of how many billion dollars ( and lives ) could be saved the next time he makes such a forecast !\nIndeed , Cohen goes on to note : \u201c Third , our analysis is informative for policymakers \u201d .\nHe finishes by noting that it \u2019 s unwise to prepare for \u201c only a decrease in severe winter weather \u201d ( there is some evidence Texas did this , judging from the performance of their backup gas plants , which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the stratospheric vortex might stretch all the way down to the Lone Star State , as shown by his cloudless , constant-albedo model of what can only charitably be related to the earth \u2019 s climate .\nSo does Cohen actually get a better handle on Texas cold outbreaks in an atmosphere with no clouds and a constant albedo ?\nExcept for Siberia , which he did brighten , which , everything else being equal , will become colder from increased snowfall precipitated by a cloudless atmosphere .\nThis allows the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get larger , increasing the likelihood that the vortex will transport some of its cold air down to Texas .\nIf you \u2019 re scratching your head after reading this , think of how much hair I lost reading Cohen \u2019 s paper .\nIt \u2019 s got a lot of pretty pictures that look seductive until you get into the details as to how they were ultimately applied by the MiMA model .\nThe bottom line is that Cohen et al .\nare going to have to be lot more convincing before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s snowfall in Siberia drives the weather thousands of miles and several months away .", "author": "curryja", "url": "https://judithcurry.com/2021/09/14/dubious-climate-science-about-the-texas-cold-disaster/", "published": "Tue, 14 Sep 2021 16:22:36 +0000",

reading the fine print of the IPCC AR6 WG1 Report .\nThe authors are to be congratulated for preparing a document that is vastly more intellectually sophisticated than its recent predecessors .\nTopics like \u2018 deep uncertainty , \u2019 model \u2018 fitness-for-purpose \u2019 ( common topics at Climate Etc . )\nactually get significant mention in the AR6 .\nFurther , natural internal variability receives a lot of attention , volcanoes a fair amount of attention ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we harken back to the IPCC AR4 ( 2007 ) , global climate models ruled , as exemplified by this quote : \u201c There is considerable confidence that climate models provide credible quantitative estimates of future climate change , particularly at continental scales and above.\n\u201d The IPCC AR4 determined its likely range of climate sensitivity values almost exclusively from climate model simulations .\nAnd its 21st century projections were determined directly from climate model simulations driven solely by emissions scenarios .\nSome hints of concern about what the global climate models are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With regards to climate sensitivity , the AR5 included this statement in a footnote to the SPM : \u201c No best estimate for equilibrium climate sensitivity can now be given because of a lack of agreement on values across assessed lines of evidence and studies.\n\u201d More specifically , observationally-based estimates of ECS were substantially lower than the climate model values .\nPerhaps more significantly , figure 11.25 in the AR5 included a subjective red-hatched area determined from \u2018 expert judgment \u2019 that the climate models were running too hot .\nIt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not similarly adjusted .\nThe IPCC AR6 takes what was begun in the AR5 much further .\nWith regards to equilibrium climate sensitivity , the AR6 breaks with the long-standing range of 1.5-4.5C and narrows the \u2018 likely \u2019 range to 2.5-4.0 C. Here is how that range compares with previous estimates and also the CMIP6 models ( as analyzed by Mark Zelinka ) : The AR6 analysis of ECS was influenced heavily by Sherwood et al .\n( 2020 ) .\nI agree with dropping the top value down from 4.5 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree with their rationale for raising the lower value from 1.5 to 2.5C .\nWithout going into detail on my concerns here , I note that Nic Lewis is working on an analysis of this .\nBut the main significance of AR6 \u2019 s narrower range is the lack of influence of the CMIP6 ECS values .\nA substantial number of the CMIP6 models are running way too hot , which has been noted in many publications .\nIn its projections of 21st century global mean surface temperatures , the AR6 provides \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with reasonable values of climate sensitivity that reasonably simulate the 20th century ) .\nFigure 4.11 from the AR6 shows the magnitude of the constraints .\nFor SSP5-8.5 , the magnitude of the constrained relative to the unconstrained CMI6 is 20 % .\nFor the first time , CMIP6 includes actual scenarios of volcanic activity and solar variability .\nCMIP6 includes a background level of volcanic activity ( no major eruptions ) and an actual projection of 21st century solar variability from Matthes ( 2017 ) ( discussed previously here ) , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of credibly handling solar indirect effects .\nThe AR6 only considers these baseline solar and volcano scenarios ; the other volcanic scenarios ( shown in Figure 1 , Box 4.1 of the AR6 ) and the Maunder minimum scenario from Matthes ( 2017 ) are surely more plausible than SSP5-8.5 and hence should have been included in the projections .\nThe AR6 also acknowledges the importance of natural internal variability , in many of the Chapters .\nCMIP6 included Single Model Initial Condition Large Ensembles ( SMILEs ; section 6.1.3 ) .\nHowever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large-scale circulation variability in observations versus most models ( IPCC AR6 Chapter 3 ) \u2013 decadal variability that is too strong and multi-decadal and centennial variability that is too weak .\nA few of the models seem to do a pretty good job , notably GFDL .\nHere are the ensemble forecasts for SSP2-4.5 , including the projections from the individual models , the \u2018 constrained \u2019 versus \u2018 unconstrained \u2019 90 % range , and the AR6 best estimate ( note this image was pulled from a CarbonBrief article ) .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the entire range ; this bias doesn \u2019 t allow much scope for natural variability ( particularly of the multi-decadal variety ) at the lower end of the model range to truly illustrate a realistic time range as to when we might pass the 1.5 and 2C \u2018 danger \u2019 thresholds .\nTo minimize some of the problems related to constraining the projections , there is an emphasis on assessing impacts at different levels of global warming , e.g .\n2 , 4 degrees C. The IPCC AR6 report provides a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chapters 10 , 12 ) .\nThe focus is on a distillation of diverse sources of information and multiple lines of evidence , and indirectly acknowledges that global climate models aren \u2019 t of much use for regional projections .\nSince the Special Report on 1.5 degrees , the IPCC has increasingly emphasized the use of climate emulators , which are highly simplified climate models ( see this CarbonBrief article for an explainer ) that are tuned to the results of the global general circulation model based Earth System Models .\nThese models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enabling pretty much anyone to run many different scenarios .\nAnd there \u2019 s no reason why this general framework couldn \u2019 t be expanded to include future scenarios of warming/cooling related to volcanoes and solar , and also multi-decadal internal variability .\nThis framework could be very useful for regional climate projections .\nHowever , climate emulators are not physics-based models .\nAre global climate models the best tools ?\nText from an essay I am writing : In the 1990 \u2019 s , the perceived policy urgency required a quick confirmation @ @ @ @ @ @

change are much more complex than was envisioned in the 1990 \u2019 s .\nThe end result is that the climate modeling enterprise has attempted a broad range of applications driven by needs of policy makers , using models that are not fit for purpose .\nComplex computer simulations have come to dominate the field of climate science and its related fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge sources of theoretical analysis and challenging theory with observations .\nIn an article aptly titled \u2018 The perils of computing too much and thinking too little , \u2019 LINK atmospheric scientist Kerry Emanuel raised the concern that inattention to theory is producing climate researchers who use these vast resources ineffectively , and that the opportunity for true breakthroughs in understanding and prediction is being diminished .\nComplexity of model representation has become a central normative principle in evaluating climate models and their policy utility .\nHowever , not only are GCMs resource-intensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also pervaded by over parameterization and inadequate attention to uncertainty .\nThe numerous problems with GCMs , and concerns that these problems will not be addressed in the near future given the current development path of these models , suggest that alternative model frameworks should be explored .\nWe need a plurality of climate models that are developed and utilized in different ways for different purposes .\nFor many issues of decision support , the GCM centric approach may not be the best approach .\nHowever , a major challenge is that nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on GCMs and IPCC production runs , with little time and funds left over for model innovations .\nThe policy-driven imperative of climate prediction has resulted in the accumulation of power and authority around GCMs ( Shackley ) , based on the promise of using GCMs to set emissions reduction targets and for regional predictions of climate change .\nHowever , the IPCC is increasingly relying on much simpler models for setting emissions targets .\nThe hope for useful regional predictions of climate change using GCMs is unlikely to be realized based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With regards to fitness for purpose of global/regional climate models for climate adaptation decision making , an excellent summary is provided by a team of scientists from the Earth Institute and Red Cross Climate Center of Columbia University : \u201c Climate model projections are able to capture many aspects of the climate system and so can be relied upon to guide mitigation plans and broad adaptation strategies , but the use of these models to guide local , practical adaptation actions is unwarranted .\nClimate models are unable to represent future conditions at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and probabilistic precision with which projections are often provided which gives a false impression of confidence to users of climate change information.\n\u201d ( Nissan et al . )\nGCMs clearly have an important role to play particularly in scientific research .\nHowever , driven by the urgent needs of policy makers , the advancement of climate science is arguably being slowed by the focus of resources on this one path of climate modeling .\nThe numerous problems with GCMs , and concerns that these problems will not be addressed in the near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest that alternative frameworks should be explored .\nThis is particularly important for the science-policy interface .\nIn the AR5 , the emphasis was on the Earth Systems Models , and their ever growing complexity in terms of adding more chemistry and some ice sheet dynamics .\nIn AR6 , these complex climate models are revealed for what they are : very complicated and computationally intensive toys , whose main results are dependent on fast thermodynamic feedback processes ( water vapor , lapse rate , clouds ) that are determined by subgrid-scale parameterizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the very large range of climate sensitivity values provided by the CMIP6 models , we are arguably in a period of negative learning .\nAnd this is in spite of the IPCC AR6 substantially reducing the range of ECS from the long-standing 1.5-4.5C to 2.5 to 4C ( reminder : I am not buying this reduction on the low end , more on this soon ) .\nSo what are we left with ?\n\u2022 Global climate models ( ESMs ) remain an important tool for understanding how the climate system works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of diminishing returns on this unless there is more emphasis on improving the simulation of modes of internal climate variability and advancing the treatment of solar indirect effects .\n\u2022 We should abandon ECS as a policy-relevant metric and work on better understanding and evaluation of TCR and TCRE from historical data .\n\u2022 In context of # 1 , I question whether the CMIP6 ESMs have much use in attribution studies .\n\u2022 ESMs have lost their utility for policy applications .\nPolicy applications are far more usefully achieved with climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of climate emulators distances policy making from a basis in physics .\nThis is particularly relevant for the legal status in various climate lawsuits of 21st century climate projections and the ESMs in various climate lawsuits .\nWhile this is hidden in the Summary for Policy Makers , it is pretty significant : \u201c A.1.3 The likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase from 1850\u20131900 to 2010\u20132019 is 0.8\u00b0C to 1.3\u00b0C , with a best estimate of 1.07\u00b0C .\nIt is likely that well-mixed GHGs contributed a warming of 1.0\u00b0C to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aerosols ) contributed a cooling of 0.0\u00b0C to 0.8\u00b0C , natural drivers changed global surface temperature by \u20130.1\u00b0C to 0.1\u00b0C , and internal variability changed it by \u20130.2\u00b0C to 0.2\u00b0C .\nIt is very likely that well-mixed GHGs were the main driver of tropospheric warming since 1979 , and extremely likely that human-caused stratospheric ozone depletion was the main driver of cooling of the lower stratosphere between 1979 and the mid-1990s.\n\u201d Compare this to the statements in the AR5 SPM : \u201c It is extremely likely that more than half of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together .\nThe best estimate of the human-induced contribution to warming is similar to the observed warming over this period.\n\u201d Overall , the AR6 WG1 report is much

\u2013 2020", "content": "The warming of the last 20 years has its essential cause in the change of the clouds .\nWe have investigated the Earth \u2019 s radiation balance over the last 20 years in a peer \u2013 reviewed publication in \u201d Atmosphere \u201d .\nThe net radiation flux , i.e .\nthe difference between solar irradiation and long- and short-wave radiation , determines the change in the energy content of the climate system .\nIf it is positive , the Earth is heating up ; if it is negative , it means cooling .\nThe NASA-operated satellite-based CERES project has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , as well as data on the development of cloud cover in temporal and spatial resolution .\nThese data are determined both in relation to an altitude of approx .\n20 km ( TOA = \u201c Top of Atmosphere \u201d ) , and also in relation to the Earth \u2019 s surface .\nOur new publication \u201c Radiative Energy flux variation from 2001 \u2013 2020\u2033 has brought to light a surprising result for climate science : the warming of the Earth in the last 20 years is mainly due to a higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nShort-wave radiation has decreased sharply over this period ( see figure ) , equally in the northern and southern hemispheres ( NH and SH ) .\nWith solar radiation remaining nearly constant , this means that more shortwave radiation has reached the Earth \u2019 s surface , contributing to warming .\nThe long-wave back radiation ( the so-called greenhouse effect ) contributed only to a lesser extent to the warming .\nIt was even largely compensated for by the likewise increasing permeability of the clouds to long-wave radiation emanating from the Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion after evaluating the CERES radiation data .\nNASA researcher Norman Loeb and collaborators [ link ] , as well as the Finnish researcher Antero Ollila [ link ] , had already recently pointed out that the short-wave solar radiation increased from 2005 to 2019 due to the decrease in low clouds .\nOur latest publication has examined TOA and ground-level radiation fluxes for the entire period and related them to changes in cloud cover .\nThe net energy influx was positive throughout the period , increasing from 0.6 W/m\u00b2 to 0.75 W/m\u00b2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average was 0.8 W/m\u00b2 .\nThe bridge chart shows the drivers of this change and these are clearly in the area of shortwave radiation in the cloudy areas , which make up about 2/3 of the Earth \u2019 s surface ( SW Cloudy Area , +1.27 W/m\u00b2 ) .\nThis contrasts with the assumption made by the IPCC in its most recent report that the warming caused by the increase in long-wave back radiation was due solely to the anthropogenic greenhouse effect .\nThe IPCC attributes 100 % of the warming to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHowever , the analysis of the measured data by D\u00fcbal and Vahrenholt shows that the warming due to the decrease of 1.4 W/m\u00b2 short-wave radiation and the \u2013 1.1 W/m\u00b2 increase in long-wave radiation is mainly attributable to the cloud effect .\nWe also considered the effect of this radiative excess on the heat content of the climate system for a longer period since 1750 , where \u201c enthalpy \u201d means the sum of heat , work and the latent heat , i.e .\nheat of evaporation of water , heat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biosphere ( plant growth ) , etc .\nSince about 90 % of this enthalpy remains as heat in the oceans , conclusions about enthalpy development can also be drawn by looking at long-term ocean heat content ( OHC ) .\nGood agreement was found between these two independent data sets for the period 2001-2020 , and existing OHC data were evaluated for earlier , longer periods to provide an overall picture .\nThis shows that warming since 1750 has not been continuous , but has occurred in heating episodes , designated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of which a high net radiative flux ( 0.7 to 0.8 W/m\u00b2 ) acted for 20-30 years , interspersed with milder phases .\nThe onset of these heating episodes coincided with the change of sign of another known natural climate factor , the AMO ( Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation ) .\nThe crucial question of whether the present heating phase C will soon come to an end as in cases A and B , or whether it will continue , can only be decided on the basis of longer observations and must therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of phase C around the year 2000 , further data sets were used , including the cloudiness measurements of EUMETSAT , a European satellite project .\nHere it can be seen that the onset of phase C is accompanied by a decrease in cloudiness , coinciding with the above-mentioned change in sign of the AMO .\nFrom the radiation measurements it can be deduced that 2 % less cloud cover means about 0.5 W/m\u00b2 more net radiation flux , which could explain most of the 0.8 W/m\u00b2 mentioned above .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the near-surface radiation balance .\nHere an increase of the greenhouse effect is found , which correlates well with the increase of the greenhouse gases water vapour and CO2 , but only for the cloudless areas ( \u201c clear sky \u201d ) .\nThis correlation , however , does not apply to the cloud-covered areas , which make up about 2/3 of the earth .\nWe could prove the increased greenhouse effect of the sum of all greenhouse gases ( water vapour , CO2 etc . )\nunder \u201c Clear Sky \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last 20 years .\nHowever , this increase is overcompensated on an area-weighted basis by the increasing radiation of long-wave radiation in the cloudy zones ( \u201c Cloudy Areas \u201d ) amounting to -1.48 W/m\u00b2 .\nThe time span of 20 years is still too short to be able to decide conclusively whether the current heating phase is a temporary or permanent development .\nIn the former case , climate forecasts will have to be fundamentally revised .\nThe physical mechanism that led to the cloud thinning is discussed differently in the literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be caused by a decrease in aerosols , by atmospheric warming due to natural causes ( e.g .\nthe AMO or the PDO ) , by anthropogenic warming due to CO2 , or by a combination of these individual factors .\nHowever , one thing can already be stated : the warming of the last 20 years has been caused more by change in the clouds than by the classical greenhouse effect .", "author": "curryja", "url": "https://judithcurry.com/2021/10/10/radiative-energy-flux-variations-from-2000-2020/", "published": "Sun, 10 Oct 2021 10:10:00 +0000", "published_utc":

energy transition", "content": "This morning I participated Conference on Energy and Decarbonization \u2013 A New Jersey Business Perspective .\nhttps : //njbia.regfox.com/energy-summit .\nNew Jersey is a leader among U.S. states in aggressively tackling the transition to cleaner sources of energy ( see the New Jersey Energy Master Plan ) .\nSo far , they have been doing a better job than California .\nThe near term challenges of the transition to clean energy are described in this article in the City Journal New Jersey has a pretty good mix of electricity generation sources : 57.2 % natural gas , 37.4 % nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal , 1.1 % biomass , 0.9 % non-biogenic waste , and 0.1 % hydroelectric & wind.New Jersey \u2019 s renewable portfolio standard was updated in 2018 to require that 21 % of electricity be from renewable sources by 2021 , 35 % by 2025 , and 50 % by 2030 .\nThis Conference was a pretty interesting event .\nHere is the agenda and list of speakers : \u2022 The Murphy Administration : Joseph L. Fiordaliso , President , Board of Public Utilities and Shawn M.LaTourette , Commissioner , Department of Environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Clean Energy Economy : Steve Westhoven , CEO , NewJersey Resources The State administration of NJ assumes that climate change is a code red emergency .\nIndustry leaders and people in the electricity sector are more concerned about energy reliability and cost , arguing for a slower transition .\nThis Conference promoted dialogue among a range of leaders and stakeholders .\nI was asked to update the audience on the latest IPCC assessment , topics of specific relevance to New Jersey , and the implications for the clean energy transition .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( hopefully you can download it ? )\nSome of the slides I \u2019 ve used before , but are included here again for completeness .\nMy verbal remarks are provided below : The climate crisis can be summarized as : \u2022 The warming is caused by us \u2022 We need to urgently transition to renewable energy to stop the warming \u2022 Once we stop burning fossil fuels , sea level rise will stop and the weather won \u2019 t be so extreme Last August , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report .\nIn response , the secretary general of the UN stated that In my talk today , I \u2019 m going to present you with a different perspective on the climate change problem and how we can approach solutions .\nSo what \u2019 s wrong with the crisis narrative ?\nIt is my assessment that \u2022 We \u2019 ve vastly oversimplified both the problem and its solutions \u2022 The complexity and uncertainty surrounding climate change is being kept away from the public and policy debates .\n\u2022 Rapid reductions in emissions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale , with adverse negative consequences .\n\u2022 And finally , the climate crisis narrative gets in the way of real solutions to our problems Even people that don \u2019 t know much about climate science have heard that 97 % of climate scientists agree .\nBut exactly what do they agree on ?\nNot nearly as much as portrayed by the media .\nEveryone agrees that : \u2022 Humans are adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere , and \u2022 Carbon Dioxide and other greenhouse gases have a warming effect on the planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the most consequential issues : \u2022 How much of the recent warming has been caused by emissions \u2022 How much the planet will warm in the 21st century \u2022 And how we should respond to the warming , to improve human well being For policy making , the most consequential issue is how much warming we can expect in the 21st century .\nThis figure from the latest IPCC report shows climate model projections of global surface temperature anomalies over the 21st century .\nThere \u2019 s a large range of warming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrees to 8 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial temperatures .\nWe \u2019 ve already warmed by more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit .\nSo whether the future warming is on the low or high end has huge implications for climate policy .\nThe largest amount of warming is associated with an extreme emissions scenario , SSP-8.5 , shown by the purple curve .\nThe large amount of uncertainty in 21st century projections of surface temperature is associated with : \u2022 The sensitivity of the climate to these emissions \u2022 And finally , there is substantial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate variability .\nOn the previous slide , recall that the largest amount of warming was associated with the emissions scenario SSP-8.5 .\nThe IPCC 5th Assessment Report regarded the 8.5 scenario to be our most likely future , and it was referred to as the business-as-usual scenario .\nHowever , it \u2019 s becoming increasingly apparent that the 8.5 scenarios are implausibly high , if not impossible .\nThe gray lines show emissions projections made by the International Energy Agency out to 2050 .\nThe IEA projections show fairly steady emissions through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 8.5 scenarios .\nThe IEA projections are even somewhat lower than the IPCC \u2019 s medium emissions scenario , SSP-4.5 .\nNevertheless , the most recent IPCC report emphasizes the 8.5 scenario .\nNot surprisingly , this extreme emissions scenario is the source of alarming impacts .\nThe second major source of uncertainty is the sensitivity of the global temperatures to a doubling of carbon dioxide .\nFor decades , the likely range for climate sensitivity has been between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees centigrade , which is reflected by the assessment from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The red bars in this figure shows the range of climate sensitivity from the most recent climate model simulations , ranging from 1.8 to 5.7 degrees .\nThese values are overall much higher than those from the AR5 , whose highest value was 4.6 degrees .\nIn spite of the larger range from the climate models , the most recent IPCC AR6 substantially narrowed the likely range of climate sensitivity to between 2.5 and 4 degrees , indicated by the vertical blue lines , rejecting the highest values from the climate models .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ disputed , particularly on the low end .\nThe whole issue of climate sensitivity to increasing carbon dioxide remains unsettled .\nThe bottom line here is some good news .\nThe extreme tail risks from global warming , associated with very high emissions and high climate sensitivity , have shrunk and are now regarded as implausible .\nSo , what is our best estimate of the amount of warming expected in the 21st century ?\nThe closest emissions scenario to the projections from the International Energy Agency is the medium emissions scenario , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 constrained \u2019 projections , that includes only the climate models with values of climate sensitivity between 2.5 and 4 degrees Centigrade .\nThe IPCC \u2019 s best estimate for warming by 2100 is 4.9 degrees Fahrenheit , relative to a preindustrial baseline for the period 1850-1900 .\nThe policy relevant targets of 1.5 and 2 degrees centigrade , indicated by the dashed lines , reflect temperature change relative to this preindustrial period .\nWe have already warmed 1.3 degrees Centigrade , or 2.3 degrees Fahrenheit .\nThe IPCC \u2019 s best estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in about 2030 , and the 2 degree threshold in about 2055 .\nThere are numerous reasons to expect that the amount of warming will be lower than the IPCC \u2019 s best estimate .\nThe current emissions trajectory is running below the 4.5 scenario .\nLower values of climate sensitivity would also delay crossing these thresholds .\nThe other factor to consider is natural climate variability .\nMajor volcanic eruptions would have a cooling effect .\nA solar minimum is expected in the 21st century , following the grand solar maximum that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Natural variability associated with the large-scale ocean circulations is also expected to contribute to cooling in the coming decades .\nWe need to recognize that how the climate of the 21st century will play out is a topic of deep uncertainty .\nOnce natural climate variability is accounted for , it may turn out to be relatively benign .\nOr we may be faced with unanticipated surprises .\nThe next area of disagreement takes us away from science and into the realm of values .\nHow dangerous is global warming ?\nThe IPCC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagram to portray reasons for concern .\nThe level of concern increases with the amount of global warming .\nNote that the IPCC does not use the words \u2018 dangerous \u2019 , \u2018 crisis \u2019 or \u2018 catastrophe \u2019 in its reports ; rather it refers to \u2018 reasons for concern.\n\u2019 Any evaluation of dangerous climate change must confront the Goldilocks principle .\nExactly which climate state is too hot versus too cold ?\nSome answer this question by stating that the climate we \u2019 re adapted to is \u2018 just right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a preindustrial baseline , in the late 1700 \u2019 s .\nWhy anyone thinks that this is an ideal climate is beyond me .\nThis was during the Little Ice Age , the coldest period of the millennia .\nThink George Washington and the horrible winters at Valley Forge .\nWhile the categories of concern in the burning embers diagram seem a bit nebulous , the 6th assessment report focused on extreme weather and climate events .\nLets take a look .\nThe recent IPCC report identified an increase in the intensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decrease in cold waves .\nThe decrease in cold events is actually very good news .\nNumerous studies have found that there are more deaths from cold events than from heat events , by as much as an order of magnitude .\nThe recent IPCC report also identified an increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy rain events .\nThe IPCC looked at the period since 1950 in assessing trends in extreme events .\nHowever , looking only at the record since 1950 can lead to weather amnesia .\nNew Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNew Jersey is rightfully concerned about impacts from hurricanes .\nBut these impacts are not necessarily worsening as a result of global warming .\nThe worst hurricane to strike New Jersey in the historical record occurred in 1821 \u2013 a category 4 hurricane with a 13 foot storm surge .\nHurricane Ida recently caused 7 inches of rain in New Jersey over 2 days .\nHow does this compare with the historical record ?\nCentral Park in New York City has a data record that goes back to the 1860 \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during 1883 , over 8 inches .\nLooking at the historical data of extreme weather events helps us avoid weather amnesia .\nFurther , it reminds us that even worse extreme weather events have occurred in the historical record , and that elimination of fossil fuel emissions isn \u2019 t going to prevent extreme weather events .\nThe recent IPCC report concluded that it \u2019 s likely that the global proportion of major hurricanes ( which are category 3 and higher ) has increased over the last four decades .\nHowever , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show a meaningful trend that can be distinguished from natural variability .\nThe left-hand diagram shows the number of major hurricanes that have made U.S. landfall since 1900 .\nThe year 2005 stands out as the highest , which was followed by a period of 11 years with no major hurricane landfalls .\nAlso , there were a large number of major hurricane landfalls during the first half of the 20th century , when surface temperatures were significantly cooler .\nThe large amount of natural variability makes it difficult to identify meaningful trends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to attribute any trend to manmade global warming .\nSea level rise is an unambiguous impact of global warming .\nThis figure shows the sea level data record for Atlantic City .\nSince 1910 , sea level has been rising at a steady rate of 1.36 feet , or 16 inches , per century .\nNew Jersey \u2019 s coastal sea level rise is somewhat larger than the global average , owing to local sinking from geological processes and extraction of ground water .\nIn 2019 , a team of scientists led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c New Jersey \u2019 s Rising Seas and Changing Coastal Storms.\n\u201d By 2100 , for the medium emissions scenario , the Rutgers report predicted a likely range of sea level rise to be between 2 and 5.1 feet .\nNew Jersey \u2019 s plan for Protecting Against Climate Threats , or PACT , adopted 5.1 feet as the basis for its regulations .\nIn January 2021 , I was contacted by Ray Cantor of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association , to provide an independent evaluation of the projections in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my report was that the Rutgers projections are substantially higher than the IPCC projections , owing to their method of incorporating extreme scenarios of instability in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet .\nThis figure is from the most recent IPCC Report .\nThe left column shows projections of global mean sea level to 2050 , and the right column shows projections to 2100 .\nThe middle row , circled in red , shows projections for the medium emissions scenario .\nLooking at the 2100 projections , the yellow bar indicates the likely range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an upper value of 2.5 feet .\nAccounting for local effects for New Jersey produces a value of 3.1 feet .\nThis value of 3.1 feet is substantially lower than the 5.1 feet cited in the Rutgers Report .\nThe latest IPCC report reinforces my previous assessment that the sea level rise projections from the Rutgers report are far too high .\nIn evaluating the dangers of climate change , it \u2019 s important to assess how global societies have dealt with the warming that we \u2019 ve already seen .\nSo far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job at adapting to weather extremes and climate change .\nThe upper left figure shows the change in yield for major crops , with yields for many crops doubling or even quadrupling since 1960 .\nThe figure in the lower left shows losses from global weather disasters as a percent of GDP .\nThe spikes are associated with years that showed large losses from tropical cyclones .\nOverall for the past 30 years , there has actually been a slight decline in losses .\nThe diagram in the lower right shows the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and climate catastrophes .\nOver the past century , climate related deaths have dropped by 97 % .\nUnder the auspices of the United Nations , the world is attempting to reach netzero in carbon emissions by 2050 .\nThis diagram from the International Energy Agency illustrates the challenge .\nThe blue curve shows expected emissions based on policies that are currently in place .\nThe yellow curve shows the pledges that countries have made as part of the Paris Agreement .\nAnd the green curve shows the path we should be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s a large gap between our current and committed policies versus the netzero target .\nThere are numerous impediments to reaching netzero : waiting for better technologies , costs of the transition , and politics surrounding natural gas and nuclear energy .\nBut most importantly , there are concerns about maintaining energy security during the transition , in terms of electricity reliability and cost .\nThe path to net zero by 2050 is generally regarded to consist of the following elements : \u2022 The fundamental premise is to eliminate fossil fuels \u2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy , focusing on solar , wind , biofuels .\n\u2022 Nuclear energy remains controversial , although there is a recent surge of support in Europe and Japan .\n\u2022 There \u2019 s an implication of austerity in terms of using less energy \u2022 In doing the carbon accounting , it is very difficult to achieve netzero by 2050 without carbon capture and storage .\nHowever , we do not currently have the capability to accomplish this at anything close to the needed scale .\nThe International Energy Agency finds that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ netzero by 2050 , provided that there \u2019 s a huge leap in energy innovation and major efforts to build new infrastructure .\nOther analysts find that reaching netzero globally by 2050 is a social and technological impossibility .\nSome countries and states can reach netzero by 2050 relatively easily if they have a large amount of hydropower or an existing base of nuclear power .\nHowever , it will be very difficult for most other regions , particularly in the face of growing population and desired economic growth .\nBut even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we should try anyways , right ?\nWell , the fundamental problem is the level of urgency .\nI \u2019 ve shown that the perception of a crisis and the level of alarm that is often portrayed in the media and by politicians is overblown .\nTargets that are too stringent lead to decisions that aren \u2019 t beneficial in the longer term .\nAnother key issue is that the demand for electricity is growing .\nWe need much more electricity , not less .\nGoing on an energy diet like we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the table .\nWe don \u2019 t just want to survive , we want to thrive .\nWe need more electricity to support innovation and thrivability in the 21st century .\nA more pragmatic approach to dealing with climate change drops the timelines and emissions targets , in favor of accelerating energy innovation .\nOnce the stringent targets are removed , you have space to imagine what the infrastructure for our 21st century electricity system could look like , with new technologies for electricity generation and a 21st century transmission infrastructure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nCompare this vision against the current plan for urgently implementing 20th century wind and solar technologies , patching them into the existing transmission grid , eliminating backup power sources of natural gas and nuclear , and then hoping for the best .\nThis is where urgently working towards NETZERO by overinvesting in wind and solar is leading us .\nNations and states are coming to grips with their over dependence on wind and solar , notably California , the UK and Europe .\nIn 2021 so far , offshore wind in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UK electricity , compared to 25 % in 2020 .\nConcerns about not meeting electricity needs next winter are resulting in a near term reliance on coal in Europe and Asia .\nYou can avoid this situation by hanging on to your existing nuclear and natural gas generating capacity .\nNuclear and natural gas are key enablers for reducing carbon emissions today in the near term .\nNatural gas is essential for keeping energy prices in check while we invest in the technology and infrastructure necessary to attain net zero in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future of the 2030 \u2019 s will look very different from the future of today .\nIn evaluating clean energy technologies , extend your horizon to the 2030 \u2019 s and build in the capability to adopt new technologies in your planning process .\nConsideration of these factors can lead to a better and even cleaner electricity system by mid century , including new technologies , such as small modular nuclear reactors and advanced geothermal .\nThe Energy Transition will be one of the most capital- and resource- intensive undertakings in the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business and industry to provide a reality check on both technical feasibility and economic realities .\nBut more importantly , we need to change the focus of conversation , and here is where business leaders can take charge .\nFocus on a 21st century vision for electric power infrastructure , with abundant , cheap and clean electricity .\nSell prosperity and thrivability as the motivations for this .\nSupport innovation .\nNot greenwashing , which the energy industry is often accused , but come up with a real plan .\nIts time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the politicians and activists .\nCome up with a good plan , and even the climate activists will have a hard time objecting

crisis that we may be in the process of causing now ?\nCosmologist , astrophysicist , and Astronomer Royal Martin Rees , award @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas Sterner , and controversial climatologist Judith Curry join us to ask if we \u2019 re heading towards a new environmental crisis .\nThis should be a very interesting event .\nEach of the panelists has been asked to respond to the following questions Will the new , green energy economy ushered in by governments save us from environmental disaster ?\n\u2022 Is the environmental crisis the greatest threat that humanity faces , and if so , how do we decide this ?\n\u2022 Is relentless consumption and growth to blame for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on humanity \u2019 s ability to solve future crises of this kind ?\nA draft of my responses is appended below : Will the new , green energy economy ushered in by governments save us from environmental disaster ?\nFor the past century , fossil fuels have been the backbone of our energy and transportation systems , providing the engine for our ever-increasing prosperity .\nEven without the mandate associated with global warming and other environmental issues , we would expect a natural transition away from fossil fuels over the course of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive to extract and continue to contribute to geopolitical instability .\nThe problem is with the urgency of transitioning away from fossil fuels , driven by fears about global warming .\nBy rapidly transitioning to this so-called clean energy economy , we \u2019 re taking a big step backwards in human development and prosperity .\nNations are coming to grips with their growing over dependence on wind and solar energy .\nConcerns about not meeting electricity needs this winter are resulting in a near term reliance on coal in Europe and Asia .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ mining and toxic waste from solar panels and batteries , and the destruction of raptors by wind turbines .\nTo thrive in the 21st century , the world will need much more energy .\nOf course we prefer our energy to be clean , as well as cheap .\nTo get there , we need new technologies .\nThe most promising right now is small modular nuclear reactors .\nBut there are also exciting advances in geothermal , hydrogen and others .\nAnd the technology landscape will look different even 10 years from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people have equated environmental disaster with manmade global warming .\nWe \u2019 ve been hearing about the climate crisis , climate catastrophe , existential threat and most recently a code red for humanity .\nNote that the IPCC itself does not use the words \u2018 crisis \u2019 , \u2018 catastrophe \u2019 , or even \u2018 dangerous \u2019 ; rather it uses the term \u2018 reasons for concern.\n\u2019 Apart from the scientific uncertainties , the weakest part of the UN \u2019 s argument about manmade global warming is that it is dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linking warming to extreme weather events , which is a tenous link at best .\nI have an old-fashioned view of environmental problems , focused on pollution of air , water , soils and the oceans , and also on land use that destroys habitats and diminishes species diversity .\nIn 50 years time , we may be looking back on the UN climate policies , and this so-called green economy , as using chemotherapy to try to cure a head cold , all the while ignoring more serious diseases .\nIn other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the way of real solutions to our societal and environmental problems .\nTheme 1 : Is the environmental crisis the greatest threat that humanity faces , and if so , how do we decide this ?\nIn 2018 , World Health Organization stated that \u201c Climate change is the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century.\n\u201d From the perspective of 2021 , after almost two years of fighting Covid with over 5 million deaths , this statement seems unfortunate at best .\nWe should be asking the question as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on climate change contributed to the world being ill prepared for Covid-19 .\nClimate change is just one of many threats facing our world today , a point made clear by the Covid-19 pandemic .\nWhy should climate change be prioritized over other threats ?\nThere \u2019 s a wide range of threats that we could face in the 21st century : Carrington events are solar electromagnetic storms that would take out all space-based electronics including GPS and electricity transmission lines ; future pandemics ; global financial collapse ; a mega volcanic eruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thermonuclear , biochemical or cyber war ; the rise of terrorism .\nIt \u2019 s almost certain that we will by surprised by threats that we haven \u2019 t even imagined yet .\nVast sums spent on attempting to prevent climate change come from the same funds that effectively hold our insurance against all threats ; this focus on climate change could overall increase our vulnerability to other threats .\nSo , how do we prioritize among the threats facing humanity ?\nFor the most part , we can \u2019 t .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these threats is to try to understand them , while increasing the overall resilience of our societies .\nProsperity is the best the indicator of resilience .\nResilient societies that learn from previous threats are best prepared to be anti-fragile and respond to whatever threats the future holds .\nHumans are the most adaptable species that has ever existed on Planet Earth , a species so sophisticated that it can survive in outer space .\nThe planet has been warming for more than a century .\nSo far , the world has @ @ @ @ @

dropped by 97 % .\nLosses from global weather disasters as a percent of GDP have declined over the past 30 years .\nIt \u2019 s an enormous challenge to minimize the environmental impact on the planet of 8 billion people .\nI have no question that human ingenuity is up to the task of better providing for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human inhabitants , while supporting habitats and species diversity .\nBut this issue is the major challenge for the next millennium .\nIt \u2019 s a complex challenge that extends well beyond understanding the Earth system and developing new technologies \u2013 it also includes governance and social values .\nTo make progress on this , we need to disabuse ourselves of the hubris that we can control the Earth \u2019 s climate and prevent extreme weather events .\nThe urgency of transitioning from fossil fuels to wind and solar energy under the auspices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxygen from the room .\nThere \u2019 s no space left for imagining what our 21st century infrastructure could look like , with new technologies and greater resilience to extreme weather events .\nUnder the auspices of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change , we \u2019 ve oversimplified a very complex problem .\nThe causes of climate variability and change are complex , and any predictions of 21st century climate change are associated with deep uncertainty .\nWe stand to make the overall situation worse with the simplistic solution of urgently replacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will have a barely noticeable impact on the climate of the 21st century .\nHumans do have the ability to solve future crises of this kind .\nHowever , they also have the capacity to make things much worse by oversimplifying complex environmental issues and politicizing the science , which can lead to maladaptation and poor policy choices .\nJC note : You need to register ( and pay ) to hear this live .\nI understand that a youtube will be prepared of the highlights , and the full recording

climate change sceptics have seized upon putative solar effects as an excuse for inaction on anthropogenic warming \u201d \u2013 Lockwood ( 2012 ) \u201c We argue that the Sun/climate debate is one of these issues where the IPCC \u2019 s \u201c consensus \u201d statements were prematurely achieved through the suppression of dissenting scienti\ufb01c opinions.\n\u201d \u2013 Connolly et al .\n( 2021 ) The impact of solar variations on the climate is uncertain and subject to substantial debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the IPCC assessment reports that there is debate or substantial uncertainty surrounding this issue .\nThe Sun goes through cycles of approximately 11 years ( the Schwabe Cycle ) in which solar activity goes up and down .\nAbove the Earth \u2019 s atmosphere , the difference in Total Solar Irradiance ( TSI , measured in Watts per square meter W/m2 ) between the 11-year maxima and minima is small , on the order of 0.1 % of the total TSI , or about 1 W/m2 .\nA multidecadal increase in TSI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being equal ) ; similarly , a multidecadal decrease in TSI should cause global cooling .\nResearchers have speculated that multi-decadal and longer changes in solar activity could be a major driver of climate change .\nExactly how TSI has changed over time has been a challenging problem to resolve .\nSince 1978 , we have had direct measurements of TSI from satellite .\nHowever , interpreting any multi-decadal trends in TSI requires comparisons of observations from overlapping satellites .\nSubstantial uncertainty exists in the TSI composites during the period from 1978 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that the ACRIM2 solar satellite mission was delayed because of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster in 1986 ( ACRIM2 was eventually launched in late 1991 ) .\nThis delay prevented this record from overlapping with the ACRIM1 record that ended in July 1989 .\nThe ACRIM-gap prevents a direct cross-calibration between the two high-quality ACRIM1 and ACRIM2 TSI records .\n[ link ] This rather arcane issue of cross-calibration of two satellite records has profound implications .\nThere are a number of rival composite TSI datasets , disagreeing as to whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1986-1996 .\nFurther , the satellite record of TSI is used for calibrating proxy models , so that past solar variations can be inferred from sunspots and cosmogenic isotope measurements .\nVelasco Herrera et al .\n2015 As a result , some of the datasets for past values of TSI ( since 1750 ) have low variability , implying very low impact of solar variations on global mean surface temperature , whereas datasets with high TSI variability can explain 50-98 % of the temperature variability since preindustrial times .\nThe IPCC AR5 adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussing this controversy .\nThe AR5 concluded that the best estimate of radiative forcing due to TSI changes for the period 1750\u20132011 was 0.05 W/m2 ( medium confidence ) .\nFor reference , the forcing from atmospheric greenhouse gases over the same period was 2.29 W/m2 .\nThus , the IPCC AR5 message was that changes in solar activity are nearly negligible compared to anthropogenic ones for forcing climate change .\nThe IPCC AR6 acknowledges a much larger range of estimates of changes in TSI over the last several centuries , stating that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1645\u20131715 ) and second half of the 20th century increased by 0.7\u2013 2.7 W/m2 , a range that includes both low and high variability TSI data sets .\nHowever , the recommended forcing dataset for the CMIP6 climate model simulations used in the AR6 averages two low variability data sets ( Matthes et al .\n2017 ) .\nThe uncertainties and debate surrounding solar variations and their impact on climate was the topic of a ClimateDialogue , a remarkable blogospheric experiment .\nClimateDialogue was the result of a request by the Dutch parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts representing the full range of views on the subject .\nThe Dialogue on solar variations ( 2014 ) included five distinguished scientists with extensive publication records on the topic .\nOne participant was in line with the IPCC AR5 , thinking that solar variations are only a minor player in the Earth \u2019 s climate .\nTwo participants argued for a larger and even dominant role for the Sun , and the other two emphasized uncertainties in our current understanding .\nMore recently , a review article was published in the journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et al .\n( 2021 ) .\nThe article has 23 co-authors with a range of perspectives , but who were united by their agreement not to take the consensus approach of the IPCC .\nRather , the paper emphasized where dissenting scientific opinions exist as well as identifying where there is scientific agreement .\nThe authors found that the Sun/climate debate is an issue where the IPCC \u2019 s consensus statements were prematurely achieved through the suppression of dissenting scientific opinions .\nOf direct relevance to projections of 21st century climate is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in solar activity .\nOn multidecadal timescales , proxy reconstructions of solar activity reveal occasional phases of unusually high or low solar activity , which are respectively called Grand Solar Minima and Maxima ( Usoskin et al.\n, 2014 ) .\nGrand solar maxima occur when several solar cycles exhibit greater than average activity for decades or centuries .\nSolar activity reached unusually high levels in the second half of the twentieth century , although there is disagreement among reconstructions as to whether this maximum peaked in the 1950 \u2019 s or continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been estimated that about 20 grand maxima have occurred over the last 11 millennia ( Usoskin et al .\n2007 ) , averaging one per 500 years .\nDuring the last 11 millennia , there have been 11 grand solar minima , with intervals between them ranging from a hundred years to a few thousand years .\nThe most recent grand minimum was the Maunder Minimum , during 1645-1715 .\n[ link ] There are several reasons to expect lower solar activity during the 21st century , relative to the 20th century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the smallest sunspot cycle in 100 years and the third in a trend of diminishing sunspot cycles .\nSolar physicists expect cycle 25 to be even smaller than Cycle 24 .\nFurther , a grand maximum is more likely to be followed by a grand minimum than by another grand maximum ( Inceoglu et al.\n, 2016 ) .\nEmpirically-based projections imply a new solar minimum starting in 2002\u20132004 and ending in 2063\u20132075 ( Velasco Herrera et al .\n2015 ) It has been estimated that there is an 8 % chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minimum during the next 40 years ( Barnard et al .\n2011 ) .\nHowever , the depth and length of a phase of low solar activity in the 21st century is largely uncertain .\nIf the Sun did fall into a minimum during mid 21st century of the magnitude of the Maunder Minimum , how much cooling could we expect ?\nEstimates from climate models and other analytical models expect the cooling to be small , ranging from 0.09 to 0.3oC ( Fuelner 2010 ) .\nThese models assume that solar-climate interaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , there is growing evidence that other aspects of solar variability amplify the TSI forcing or are independent of TSI forcing , which are referred to as solar indirect effects .\nCandidate processes include : solar ultraviolet changes ; energetic particle precipitation ; atmospheric-electric-field effect on cloud cover ; cloud changes produced by solar-modulated galactic cosmic rays ; large relative changes in the magnetic field ; and the strength of the solar win .\nSolar indirect effects can be classified as \u2018 known unknowns.\n\u2019 While these indirect effects are not included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can make some inferences based upon recent publications .\nRecent research suggest that solar indirect effects could amplify an anomaly in solar insolation by a factor of up to 3-7 .\nShaviv ( 2008 ) , Scafetta ( 2013 ) Svensmark ( 2019 ) .\nIf such an amplification factor is included , then a surface temperature decrease of up to 1oC ( or even more ) from a Maunder Minimum could occur .\nSo , what are plausible scenarios for solar-driven global temperature changes in the 21st century ?\nThese three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : \u2022 Intermediate : -0.3oC , corresponds to high Maunder minimum estimate without amplification effects ( Fuelner 2010 ) , or a weaker minimum with amplification effects \u2022 High : -0.6oC , a low solar scenario ( which is not a Maunder Minimum ) with amplification by solar indirect effects Solheim The next 20 to 30 years of observations should reveal a lot about the role of the Sun in climate .\nThe IPCC acknowledges substantial uncertainty in changes of TSI over the last centuries , stating that the TSI between the Maunder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 20th century increased by 0.7\u2013 2.7 W/m2 , a range that includes both low and high variability TSI data sets .\nHowever , the recommended forcing dataset for the CMIP6 climate model simulations used in the AR6 averages two low variability data sets ( Matthes et al .\n2017 ) .\nThe implications of such large uncertainty in TSI on equilibrium climate sensitivity and attribution of 20th century warming are ignored by the IPCC .\nIf the high variability data sets are correct , this has substantial implications for estimates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 20th century warming .\nThis issue can \u2019 t continue to be swept under the rug .\nOther authors are not ignoring this .\nHere are three recent publications for discussion : Scafetta : Testing the CMIP6GCM simulations versus surface temperature records from 1980-1990 to 2010-2020 [ link ] Connolly et al : How

played on a relatively tiny stage , ClimateBall\u2122 points to fundamental processes , which across the vastly larger global public stage and involving billions of meme transactions annually , have caused the emergence of a cultural belief-system based upon the narrative of \u2018 certain catastrophic climate-change \u2019 .\nClimate blogger \u2018 Willard \u2019 has put significant efforts into a large taxonomy of skeptical challenges ( the \u2018 Bingo Matrix \u2019 or \u2018 Contrarian Matrix \u2019 ) and brief rejoinders to same .\nAlong with the very useful characterization of especially the rhetoric aspects of the conflicted skeptic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagement not based primarily upon rational argument leading where it will , but one with different rules , a kind of ritual or game : ClimateBall\u2122 .\nEverything herein is my own view of ClimateBall , and what it points to .\nWillard \u2019 s site describing this game , with its interlinked plus well laid-out taxonomy of challenges / rejoinders , has been slowly developing for some time and from its own description is still at an early stage .\nI \u2019 ve found it most interesting , not regarding the domain-related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point-of-view .\nAlthough highly aligned to a particular \u2018 Battleground \u2019 , i.e .\nexchanges that occur within the climate-change blogosphere plus associated forums / knowledge-rich venues / social-media ( in the spirit of the game I will term this the Clogosphere [ 1 ] ) , ClimateBall captures some essence of the critical processes that also occur in the much vaster and far less constrained global public sphere ( which is not at all climate-science literate ) .\nThis article draws comparisons between the battleground of ClimateBall , and the enormously amplified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage : \u2018 Public ClimateBall \u2019 , or \u2018 ClimateBall Big \u2019 .\nGames have rules , and although there are many constraints in the Clogosphere compared to the global public stage , some of the rules and indeed some of the very same subject material , are present in both environments ; yet with very different outcomes .\nClimateBall Big is a different league .\nIn the FaQ for ClimateBall , blogger ATTP ( Professor Ken Rice ) is quoted regarding the spirit of ClimateBall : \u2018 [ I ] t \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not .\nIf you \u2019 re going to get involved , it \u2019 s best that you understand that it is [ a ] game , how to play the game , and what the rules [ 2 ] are.\n\u2019 Each skeptical challenge in the Matrix has its own link , boiled down to the essence of what the challenge is about .\nFor example Historical Times , Consensus , Extreme Events , Renewables , etc .\nEach skeptical challenge has the word \u2018 but \u2019 added in front of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 , \u2018 But Consensus \u2019 , etc .\nThis is of course a rhetorical device in itself , yet usefully serves as caution that the challenges might be more about rhetoric and bias than about rational content .\nThis is as seen from an orthodox PoV , but this PoV is the widest net for catching skeptical rhetoric , should this indeed form a main component of the challenge .\nAnd if any skeptics arguing each point are tripped over by such a very simple device , maybe the device found out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they \u2019 re just ClimateBall novices , losing the play but not necessarily the point .\nAnd the game operates in both directions of course .\nOne could add the \u2018 But \u2019 precursor to every orthodox challenge , laying the gauntlet that maybe these are not well-founded .\nWhile this is hardly the way to proceed with rational debate , an element of ritual gaming has been a part of the Clogosphere for years , in part nourished by newer players sucked in .\nTo separate the game from rational exchange that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pretty useful to have a map of it .\nAnd a map from any PoV is a useful start .\nWhether some of the \u2018 buts \u2019 are actually false positives ( in the detection of rhetoric sense ) , and how much the given rejoinders to each skeptical challenge might also lean upon rhetorical devices and bias rather than full objectivity , is likely recursive within the game .\nSome points include domain knowledge that itself is disputed plus isn \u2019 t easy to untangle from \u2018 pure \u2019 rhetoric .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be helpful and might not be a mirror image , which itself would be interesting .\nThe identification of as many known fallacies as can be found , would I think help to make maps from any PoV more convincing .\nYet much more important than maps , is what the perceptive notion of a game points to .\nThe Central Square of the Matrix : \u2018 CAGW \u2019 The heart of the matrix and highest profile skeptical proposition is : \u2018 But CAGW \u2019 , where CAGW = Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 \u201c CAGW \u201d { 1 } is a contrarian strawman of the scientific established view \u2019 .\nUsage and controversy regarding the \u2018 CAGW \u2019 acronym is discussed in detail at Climate Etc .\nhere ( with a pre-cursor / partner post here ) ; which posts also point out that indeed mainstream science ( the IPCC technical papers ) does not support certain global catastrophe from anthropogenic climate-change or global-warming , the general meaning of the acronym .\nBut while skeptics might often and inappropriately lay it at the door of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t invent this position .\nOn a massive scale and with a landslide victory ( as confirmed below ) , this is the winning thread in ClimateBall Big .\n\u2018 CAGW \u2019 is a focus for both leagues .\nAccelerant and inhibitors for the game If there was no game , fully rational debate would lead only to withheld judgement in the absence of enough evidence , or with sufficient ( overwhelming ) evidence to choose between candidate theories , the emergence of provisional ( almost certain ) answers consistent with the evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no rules outside the normal process of testing candidates against the evidence .\nSo , what fuels the game ?\nWhat leads to different rules ?\nA clue is in the frequently emotive nature of many exchanges ( unfortunately , often negative emotions ) .\nMany different fallacies and detailed bias mechanisms have pervaded the Clogosphere , these always occur systemically in conflicted domains where group identities are at stake .\nAnd the ultimate driver of group or \u2018 tribal \u2019 identity is emotive ( so not rational ) conviction about accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , which in principle can literally bypass rationality for group adherents .\nThis leads to rules that are more to do with emotive selection and an evolving population of false narrative variants , than with rationality .\nAnd ultimately , can create an environment in which emotive content and rhetoric devices have more power than evidence .\nOppositely , where emotive convictions are resisted , exchanges drop out of the game and progress rationally .\nRational exchange promotes more rational exchange ; it \u2019 s a game inhibitor .\nBattlegrounds : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted all the above , the Clogosphere is actually a place of relative sanity .\nOn average the Clogosphere is pretty climate-literate , hugely so compared to the public domain , which means there is knowledge to feed rational exchanges even if that doesn \u2019 t always happen .\nAnd notwithstanding enough emotively driven plays to earn their own taxonomy ( I look forward especially to the forthcoming sections of the ClimateBall Manual : IV-Climateball Tricks , V-Climateball Strategies , and VI-Climateball Principles ) , arbitrary evolution of narratives is severely constrained .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s quote above ; the writ of ClimateBall in the Clogosphere is very far from all-powerful .\nWhile there are emotive redoubts and a significant proportion of emotively driven exchanges , and indeed it \u2019 s more than handy to have an idea of the game , playing is by no means compulsory and there \u2019 s a great deal of rationality too .\nWhile a never-ending-audit [ 3 ] , another useful concept expressed by Willard , can be a very negative phenomenon when executed by a mono-culture , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and position audits everyone else , a never-ending-audit is net healthy and severely limits the extent to which emotive memes can depart from reality .\nWithout this limit , such memes can achieve run-away evolution , hence asserting an arbitrary mono-culture based upon complete falsehood .\nFor instance , a constant fire-watch on \u2018 CAGW \u2019 by both skeptics and the orthodox ( from very different perspectives and for different reasons [ 4 ] ) , prevents this meme from ever gaining purchase in the Clogosphere .\nEven as it remains an incessant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop the fire-watch from ever lapsing .\nWhich leads us to what must happen on the battleground of the global public space .\nThis space is essentially devoid of climate knowledge , subject to less rational audit as decades pass , and fosters demonization of any remaining audit functions .\nNor is it constrained by any sense of \u2018 doing science \u2019 or weighing evidence .\nPlus , it is also several orders of magnitude larger than the Clogosphere .\nAs there are now few countries left where sizeable portions of publics haven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of memetic transactions that occur annually in the global public space must be in the billions .\nTransactions = transmits , receives ( much bigger than transmits due to various broadcast functions ) , and modifications .\nWhile smaller , the latter rise as transactions rise , which leads to faster rates of evolution ; so narrative variants can swiftly pivot to challenges ( such as covid , for instance ) .\nFrom a \u2018 selfish meme \u2019 PoV , the burdens of evidence , inconvenient rationality and never-ending-audit that clog up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the gaming ruleset applies .\nEmotive selection is a major part of that ruleset .\nAlthough it isn \u2019 t so simple as \u2018 the most emotive meme takes all \u2019 , nevertheless such a meme rises to the top-dog position .\nAnd it \u2019 s difficult to be more emotive than certain global catastrophe for the planet .\nIn practice , a whole population of associated variants implemented by a plethora of rhetoric devices live under the top-dog narrative , which directly or indirectly sponsors them .\nThis allows for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u2018 hope and fear \u2019 ) that leverage more support , plus reduces the effect whereby highly emotive variants induce not only emotive conviction , but also emotive rejection at the same time ( cultures are polarizing ) .\n\u2018 Softer \u2019 narratives still linked to the top-dog can increase the number of adherents \u2018 on the sly \u2019 , prompting less rejection and pulling in wider ( albeit less ardent ) support for the overall cultural agenda .\nA key sub-theme is \u2018 salvation \u2019 ( via a crash Net-Zero program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of runaway narrative evolution the CAGW fairy-story dominates the global public space .\nAs it has slowly captured institutions and the machinery of governments plus mainstream media , church leaders , influencers and uncle Tom Cobbly and all , then less and less rational audit prevents its spread .\nRelative to the Clogosphere , this is not at all a rational space .\nRationality is effectively vanquished .\nFor full clarity , from here on I add the implied \u2018 certain \u2019 catastrophe ( absent salvation via crash Net-Zero ) to the acronym @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free from all encumbrances causes different sub-narrative variants to be surfaced compared to the Clogosphere ( which is mainly about science and policy even where exchanges fall prey to ClimateBall ) .\nI term the population of narrative variants sponsored by the top-dog theme of CCAGW , \u2018 Catastrophe Narrative \u2019 .\nIt \u2019 s more intuitive that in the Global Public Space , the processes driving masses of individuals to the tune of emotive narratives are largely subconscious .\nCultural drives are the oldest and most potent way of aligning human activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspiracy / nefarious plot is required .\nNotwithstanding that in any barrel there \u2019 ll be a few bad apples , there \u2019 s no reason to suppose that this is different for the gaming aspects of the Clogosphere .\nPeople aren \u2019 t emotive because they \u2019 re knowingly pushing a false agenda , but because they deeply believe they \u2019 re pushing the truth , and against what is frequently perceived as deliberate resistance ; yet such strong ( group ) belief can blind any of us .\nThe overall effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to measure , maybe impossible .\nParticular encounters can be catalogued , but they \u2019 re often highly entwined from multiple positions , may well be inconclusive , and the Clogosphere remains stubbornly riven with rationality that undermines or even short-circuits plays .\nNor are formal surveys generally carried out on the Clogosphere .\nSome attempts to characterize websites and traffic seem too simplistic to tell us anything that denizens didn \u2019 t already know .\nFrom purely the gaming PoV it has a word-war one-ish character , a stalemate punctuated by ritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measuring the effect of ClimateBall Big is certainly possible .\nThere are quite a number of relevant surveys covering the global public space .\nAnd while public authorities are not separately surveyed , for the higher-profile ones at least their clear statements are frequently recorded on the internet , which means a useful catalogue can be compiled .\nAuthority stances both indicate the level of cultural penetration achieved , plus for any given period , what narrative is pushing corresponding publics via authority influence .\nThe section below covers such a catalogue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public authorities ; the section after that covers the mass response of global publics .\nOverall , ClimateBall Big has an early world-war two-ish character , a constant conquering of territory \u2013 so far memetic Blitzkrieg is winning .\nThe Climate Etc .\nguest post here briefly describes some of the Catastrophe Narrative variants as propagated by many authority sources ( from presidents and prime ministers and UN elite on downwards ) across many nations , plus supplies an archive file containing many more ( 179 quotes from 157 sources ) .\nI @ @ @

precise quotes see the archive , which I reattach here ( I \u2019 ve never had time to add more quotes since 2018 , but there are now many internal links for moving easily around the file ) .\nSome particular phrases are more explicit / extreme than in the summary below .\nWhile some seem more obviously emotive memes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mistake \u2018 Earth is a car heading for a brick-wall \u2019

the climate-criminals , but also starting to plan seriously for civilizational decline and collapse \u201d .\nRupert Read .\nPublic surveys don \u2019 t generally ask what people think about climate apocalypse and simultaneous salvation , the core of Catastrophe Narrative .\nHowever , many questions / answer-options approach this to various emotive degrees by asking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm , or offering terms like \u2018 extremely serious \u2019 to describe climate-change , or offering a list of national or global issues from which climate-change can be picked as the single-most or 1 of N most important issues .\nThese allow us to see emotive convictions in publics across nations [ 5 ] , who have been soaked in Catastrophe Narrative for decades .\nAs Catastrophe Narrative is cultural and contradicts mainstream science ( and skeptical science ) , we expect responses to dominantly conform to a cultural pattern if it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this the case ?\nThe chart below shows a basic summary ( less series , less features ) of climate-change \u2018 most supportive \u2019 responses across national publics , to various survey questions .\nText of the questions is listed at the end of this post .\nTwo features of the chart shout out that a strong \u2018 climate culture \u2019 is indeed being interrogated here ; religiosity is acting as the \u2018 lens \u2019 via which we can see it .\nBut first , some nomenclature and context .\nThe grey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions , i.e .\nthose asking about climate-change relative to other real-world issues / policies / financing .\nSuch questions have different strengths of constraint .\nE.g .\npicking climate-change ( or a related policy ) as a single priority from 9 issues , is a stronger constraint than picking climate-change as one of 5 priorities from 12 .\nPicking from national issues is a stronger constraint than picking from global issues ( less perceived personal impact from the latter ) .\nThe black trends are climate-change supportive responses to unconstrained questions .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , allowing full expression of cultural commitments absent any clash or compromise with reality .\nSuch questions have different strengths of emotive alignment to Catastrophe Narrative .\nAnd in regard to posited climate-change harms , the emotive ranking is : personal beats national beats global .\nBecause cultures are emotively polarizing , all the black trends should intersect somewhere .\nThis isn \u2019 t the case for the reality-constrained responses , as long as each represents a unique and non-equivalent reality .\nSo , the trendline key is : \u2018 SA \u2019 = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u2018 MWA \u2019 = Medium-Weak-Aligned , and \u2018 WA \u2019 = Weakly-Aligned .\n\u2018 FC \u2019 = Fully-Constrained , \u2018 SC \u2019 = Strongly-Constrained , \u2018 MC \u2019 = Medium-Constrained , and \u2018 WC \u2019 = Weakly-Constrained .\nNote : the \u2018 MC \u2019 trend is intuited ; I haven \u2019 t yet found a series roughly bisecting the space between \u2018 SC \u2019 and \u2018 WC \u2019 .\nNote : due to noise , the RH end of \u2018 MWA \u2019 lands bang on top of \u2018 WA \u2019 .\nHence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added to MWA , in order to make the conceptual situation clearer .\nThe first shout-out is that the systemic differences between the grey and black trends should always occur when interrogating a strong culture .\nThe two different response types will be similarly grouped , and the unconstrained trends will intersect while the reality-constrained ones won \u2019 t .\nFor instance , this exactly occurs when interrogating religion ( and with basic enough values , across all main Faiths ) .\nIn one-dimension so to speak , i.e .\nwhen plotting faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the same X-axis of National Religiosity , then all the trends must slope the same way .\nBut otherwise , the features are the same .\nAnd we know that religion is wholly cultural .\nThe second shout-out that attitudes to climate-change are cultural , is the apparent paradox that those nations expressing by far the most concerns about climate-change ( RH ends of black trends ) , also express the least priority for climate-change relative to other issues / policies ( RH ends of grey trends ) .\nAnd the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grey and black trends overlap more .\nSuch a pattern can \u2019 t possibly come from the climate or climate exposure of nations , or climate-science or related policy aims , or indeed anything rational .\nYet this can arise from cultural motivation ; cultures feature fundamental contradictions that may sometimes achieve blatant expression .\nIn this case , it \u2019 s due to a dual interaction between religion and \u2018 climate culture \u2019 .\nTogether , these shout-outs tell us that public attitudes to climate-change are indistinguishable from those for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public space , climate-change is essentially a secular religion .\nThis is the result of ClimateBall Big to date , a memetic game in which Catastrophe Narrative , with it \u2019 s top-dog theme of CCAGW , has triumphed .\nThe victory of Catastrophe Narrative in ClimateBall Big isn \u2019 t just an academic matter , because real-world phenomena are driven by the cultural attitudes of national publics to climate-change .\nFor instance , the level of climate-activism per nation also follows a simple and dominantly cultural pattern .\nPerhaps not a complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to renewable energy ( Solar and Wind ) per nation , meaning that this does not depend primarily on the climate or climate exposure of nations , nor science or engineering issues , nor objective policy generally .\nThis ought to be a concern to everyone across the spectrum of climate-change opinion , from the skeptical to the highly concerned .\nVia emotive selection , cultural entities steer us en-masse to pour resource into not solving their touted problem , which maximizes their spread and influence , while a genuine solution would kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main source of animosity in various green groups ( and Greta ) to nuclear as the heavy-lifter in Net-Zero solutions .\nAnd all this is why I probe the big league that determines events , not the little league ; yet the concept of ClimateBall is nevertheless a helpful one .\n[ 1 ] From the ClimateBall Manual : \u2018 More Dance than Sport \u2019 .\nA clog-dance seemed appropriate : Climateblogosphere .\n[ 2 ] Willard has on occasion noted transgression of the rules , e.g .\n\u2018 ClimateBall malpractice \u2019 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ true rhetoric competition driven by emotive bias is never malpractice whatever path it follows .\nOr from an alternate perspective , compared to 100 % objectivity and rationality it is always malpractice , so separating out one \u2018 transgression \u2019 due to bias from all other transgressions , is not too meaningful .\n[ 3 ] A key tool of \u2018 the grey men \u2019 in the 1973 novel Momo , by Michael Ende , via which they steal time .\n[ 4 ] Both sides in the Clogosphere disbelieve this meme .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skeptics often presume it must be mainstream science that produced and underwrites \u2018 CAGW \u2019 , which as noted earlier is not the case .\nThe orthodox often presume it must be a skeptic strawman , rather the winner of ClimateBall Big .\nIt \u2019 s notable though that science has consistently turned a blind eye to the rise of \u2018 CAGW \u2019 / Catastrophe Narrative in the public domain .\n[ 5 ] Excluding those where a one-party state suppresses religion , as this warps the lens of religiosity through which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , North Korea .\nAnd also for different reasons the US ; the same cultural principles hold but there is more complexity due to a 4-way cultural dance ( Rep/Con culture , Dem/Lib culture , religion , and \u2018 climate-culture \u2019 ) .\nIn the rest-of -world it \u2019 s only a 2-way dance , religion and \u2018 climate-culture \u2019 .\nThe US scenario can still be tied to the pattern in the chart , but it \u2019 s outside the scope of this post .", "author": "curryja", "url":

A Different Perspective with Judith Curry: Part II", "content": "My follow up interview on the Strong And Free podcast [ link ] .\nMy previous interview with Christopher Balkaran was discussed in this post .\nI also very much enjoyed our 2nd conversation .\nAt this point , the only interviews I \u2019 ve been giving are long-form discussions ( order one hour ) .\nI have no interest in scoring sound-bite points , and I \u2019 m not very good at it anyways .\nI also like talking with interviewers from other countries .\nA transcript of the interview is provided below .\nI have heavily edited this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people hopefully want to read , while preserving the content of interview .\nI am really a much better writer than speaker , especially with off-the-cuff responses to questions .\nWe covered a lot of range , I hope this interview will stimulate some interesting discussion .\nSo , there \u2019 s been a lot of feedback from our first conversation and I wanted to dive right in , because I think that \u2019 s what a lot of people want to know more about .\nNow I will say the vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very positive .\nBut the folks that were very critical raised some very compelling arguments that I \u2019 d love for you to discuss .\nAnd the first was about climate modelling when it comes to climate change .\nAnd I know in the past , people have asked you about why you \u2019 re so critical about of climate change modelling in particular .\nAnd some of your critics say , well , there \u2019 s so much robust data out there .\nIt \u2019 s been tested time and time again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face of being critical of climate change modelling .\nWhat are your thoughts about that ?\nThe IPCC AR 6 published a report last August , and I have to say they joined me in a lot of the criticisms of global climate models .\nIn fact , for the first time , for their projections to 2100 , while they show all the models , they constrained the projections , picking the ones that they like , which happened to be on the lower end .\nThere \u2019 s also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global climate models for policy purposes , but just to use simple climate emulators , that input some very basic things like which emissions scenario , which value of climate sensitivity , and off you go .\nThe other thing that the IPCC had to say , which joins me , is that these climate models do not simulate extreme weather events .\nTheir resolution is too coarse .\nSo any projections about future hurricanes , rainfall rates , whatever , are semi empirically based on observations , they \u2019 re not directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then the third factor is with regards to regional climate change .\nThe IPCC AR6 thoroughly acknowledges that global climate models can not simulate regional climate variability with any kind of skill because they don \u2019 t get the magnitude and the timing of the major modes natural internal climate variability , which have a dominant role in regional climates .\nIn fact , the IPCC spent three chapters devoted to regional climate change .\nAnd at first I was really excited .\nDo they have a recipe for how we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t , you have to distill multiple lines of evidence \u2013 models , historical data , paleo climate data , process models , physical reasoning .\nThere \u2019 s no simple answer , but you sure as heck can \u2019 t just use what the global climate models spit out .\nA model that simulates the warming since 1970 based on CO2 emissions does not constitute proof that CO2 has caused the warming .\nThe latest post on my blogs cites some papers that show that solar variability can explain pretty much all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have models that get the right answer or something close to the right answer for the wrong reasons .\nThat \u2019 s very fascinating .\nTwo follow-up questions on that .\nJudith .\nWhat were some of the reasons why the IPCC kind of walked back from alarmist reports from the past , which , mentioned high levels of global warming that would happen in the very near future if drastic action hadn \u2019 t been done ?\nTwo things they \u2019 ve backed off quite a bit .\nThe first is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to be called business as usual .\nIt \u2019 s not business as usual .\nIt \u2019 s some crazy extreme scenario that is highly implausible , if not impossible .\nSo they backed off on that one .\nThe other thing is that the latest generation of climate models in the so-called CMIP6 simulation series , about a half of them were running way too hot , with equilibrium climate sensitivities of over five degrees .\nAnd they don \u2019 t do a good job of reproducing 20th century temperature history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models included some new cloud feedback processes , sort of arcane details about how clouds interact with aerosols .\nOn one level , it \u2019 s improving the physics , but on another level they didn \u2019 t include countervailing negative feedbacks that were needed to really make this work in the model .\nAs a result , the models were just running way too hot .\nAnd so the IPCC sort of danced around it and then did a constrained selection of the climate model simulations , resulting in much more moderate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models .\nThe second follow-up to that \u2013 the comments I received back from our first conversation was Judith Curry is basing this on her own modeling and discounting the vast data that \u2019 s out there .\nI don \u2019 t run a climate model .\nI don \u2019 t have my own climate model .\nI interpret the results from other climate models .\nI rely much more heavily on observations , including a longer historical record .\nAnd I also look at paleo climate observations in my analysis .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThere are many individuals who have reached out with very detailed data and are very passionate about this topic .\nAnd it seems like if you \u2019 re not \u201c on the right side \u201d you \u2019 re lambasted instead of having a nuanced conversation , it \u2019 s definitely you \u2019 re either an unbeliever .\nYou \u2019 re a believer .\nAnd I \u2019 d love to know from your perspective , being someone who \u2019 s been in that space and has been in many ways , accosted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some of the underpinning reasons for that to be , which is specific to the climate change space ?\nFirst of all , this whole issue has become a big part of tribal political identity .\nSomebody who \u2019 s in the right tribe can publish something that \u2019 s moderately critical or skeptical and they get away with it .\nSomebody who \u2019 s not in the right tribe , who says the same thing can \u2019 t get away with it \u2013 it either gets ignored or people in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this is asymmetrical since one side has the political power .\nThe other thing is there are certain aspects of climate science that are fairly basic , there \u2019 s a lot of data out there and much of climate science is based on basic physics and thermodynamics .\nAnd so a lot of people who understand statistics or basic physics say , I can look at that problem or I can try to analyze this .\nAnd so there \u2019 s a lot of passionate armchair scientists out there cranking through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it is crankology .\nBut some people have genuinely made really good contributions who are not PhD educated climate scientists .\nMy colleague , Nic Lewis is a case in point he \u2019 s , he \u2019 s a financier .\nHe has degrees in physics and math from Oxford , but not a PhD .\nHe \u2019 s very good at statistics and he \u2019 s taken on the climate sensitivity problem and has published maybe a dozen papers , in reputable journals and even co-authored with a number of distinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of somebody who started off in this armchair mode , but actually ended up taking it to the next level and making contributions that are recognized by the mainstream and even cited in IPCC reports .\nSo the challenge is to separate the wheat from the chaff , but it \u2019 s really good for the populace to be engaged and thinking about the problem and looking at the data and so on .\nAlot of interesting research is having difficulty getting published in what I would call mainstream climate journals , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afield and publish in astronomy and space physics or environmental engineering journals or something like that , where it \u2019 s not quite so religious , then they can get it published .\nSo , it \u2019 s not a good situation , this whole tribalism thing has polluted the science .\nA lot of the \u2018 big \u2019 journals and editors do gate-keeping that seems politically motivated .\nThat \u2019 s very unfortunate for promoting reasoned , scientific debate and dialogue which is what the journals are supposed to do .\nYeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion on what journal articles are getting approved and funded and , and how that shapes public opinion .\nI wanted to talk to you because people said , \u201c Christopher , you agreed too much with Judith Curry on your podcast !\n\u201d So you need to challenge her .\nOne thing that some mentioned was that in your articles , you talk a lot about food security , water and energy .\nAnd it kind of is divorced from the emissions discussion .\nAnd so I wanted to know from you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re experiencing really severe weather patterns in the west coast and British Columbia right now .\nAnd as I was reading those , I was thinking exactly about what you said , which is why don \u2019 t we focus on our wastewater management .\nIt seems that when we talk about climate change , that \u2019 s muddled into the emissions discussion .\nAnd reducing emissions seems to be the number one priority .\nWhy do you think it \u2019 s important that we separate the two and respond to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of climate change adaptation has taken second or third seat behind emissions .\nEven if we do manage to fix the emissions problem , you \u2019 re still going to get crazy floods and storms in British Columbia .\nI mean , they \u2019 re not going to go away .\nYou can say , well global warming makes it 3 % worse \u2013 maybe it does , but it \u2019 s not like these storms still aren \u2019 t going to occur .\nSo the whole issue of reducing vulnerability and adapting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should transcend the global warming debate .\nWe need to reduce our vulnerability to these weather and climate extremes .\nMany places have too much water or too little water , even in the same region during different seasons .\nSo , the challenge is to better manage the reservoirs and sewage systems .\nYou need to figure out how to manage your water so you can buffer against the extreme wet and the extreme dry .\nAnd building in floodplains and right on the coast just causes problems .\nThese issues are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that they might be impacted at a few percent level by man-made global warming .\nEven if we fix man-made global warming , these problems won \u2019 t go away .\nThat \u2019 s why I emphasize solutions that support human wellbeing , minimize losses and so forth and so on .\nAnd food is another issue .\nWe produce enough food globally , the challenge is getting it distributed in the right places .\nHelping places produce their own food in developing world , making better decisions about their agriculture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company just got funded for a new project to develop an agricultural forecast system for one of the states in Pakistan .\nWe \u2019 re working with an NGO and agronomists who are on the ground in Pakistan .\nWe provide the forecast information so they can make better choices about which seeds they plant for a given season .\nThey can time their planting based on monsoon onsets .\nAnd they can maximize irrigation based on understanding when the monsoon break periods will come along .\nThey can use information about severe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure they pick their crops before they all get flattened by the wind and on and on .\nSo there \u2019 s a lot of little things like that that do not cost a heck of a lot of money where you can use information to optimize your yield to the extent that countries can grow their own food .\nThis really makes the global food supply much more secure .\nA lot of little things like that that you can do , and that \u2019 s not to mention all the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hardiness and the nutrition of the crops .\nAnd then if you go to energy security , I mean , what is the point of all this ?\nIf we destroy the energy security of the planet , by having electricity that \u2019 s intermittent , unreliable and too expensive , that \u2019 s not helpful to anyone .\nWe \u2019 re headed towards a real reckoning here , you can \u2019 t run industrial economies on wind and solar .\nPeople are starting to realize this .\nWithin the last few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are suddenly saying nuclear is the answer .\nWell , yeah , it sort of is , but why are you just realizing this now ?\nThe realities of wind power are being realized .\nIn the North Sea , they have all these offshore wind turbines .\nIn 2020 these produced 25 % of England \u2019 s power , which is fabulous .\nBut in the first 10 months of 2021 , they produced 7 % of the power .\nSo England and the rest of Europe is scrambling , having to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then with all the political problems with the natural gas supply from Russia .\nSo , being able to produce your energy from within your country has a lot of appeal .\nThe one advantage of solar and wind as it gave some local autonomy to the countries , but wind and solar are not enough to run an industrial economy .\nAnd nuclear power gives you the best of both worlds .\nAnd also if the countries were to frack for natural gas , that \u2019 s another energy source that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important issue is energy security , so that its abundant and reliable , and you \u2019 re not held hostage to other countries or crazy price spikes .\nI have no problem with going to cleaner energy sources .\nEverybody would prefer clean over dirty energy .\nBut energy security has to be first and foremost , we have to have reliable , affordable energy .\nOtherwise , none of this makes sense .\nI \u2019 m so glad you raised energy security .\nCause that was one thing I wanted to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so complex and you raise a lot of really important points that are politics being one of them , for sure .\nCanada , we are a naturally wealthy country and shipping natural gas to China helping them lower their CO2 emissions is great .\nBut that requires a lot of pipeline development here in Canada .\nThere \u2019 s a lot of environmental regulations working with Indigenous communities and organizations .\nSo it \u2019 s very challenging sometimes and often it \u2019 s people see the short term , the pipeline development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local ecosystems and not potentially the long term , which is potentially lower CO2 emissions .\nAnd the biggest polluter in the world \u2019 s emissions will go down and that \u2019 s a good thing .\nBut I do think that most people see the real cost with introducing new technologies , like wind and solar to replace entire energy systems because energy security is the critical point here .\nWhy do you think that there \u2019 s this push specifically for wind and solar for governments to adopt , despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , and the costs being so high ?\nI see this consistent narrative that with more investments , those costs will come down .\nIt will be more affordable for developed nations to use as a viable solution .\nCaveat to that too , is I think if we do use solar on a large scale amount doesn \u2019 t , it require a lot of land mass ?\nWind power requires a huge amount of land use .\nThere are ecosystem disruptions , raptors being killed by wind turbines .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was you couldn \u2019 t disrupt wildlife habitats , but now it \u2019 s okay to wholesale kill raptors with wind turbines .\nWhat happened to the traditional environmental values and concerns ?\nThey \u2019 ve all been thrown out the window because of global warming .\nThe other issue I see is the waste , the end of life , what to do with all this toxic stuff from the solar panels and the wind turbines .\nFor these to make environmental sense , there needs to be a lot of recycling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then there \u2019 s the issue of mining , all these batteries and the solar panels need cobalt , lithium , copper , on and on it goes .\nIn the seventies and eighties , there were wars in the Middle East because of oil .\nNow , will there be wars in the countries that are naturally rich in terms of these minerals ?\nThis is where the next geopolitical conflicts are going to be .\nAgain , if we go nuclear with Thorium , we bypass all this .\nIf you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when people were first talking about , oh , we need to stop this whole CO2 thing , there were two groups that jumped on this .\nIt was the petroleum people and the nuclear people , they wanted to squeeze out coal .\nThe oil and gas people ended up being ascendant as anti-nuclear sentiments took over .\nAnd then there was the big push for renewables .\nWe \u2019 ve already seen the problems with wind and solar .\nBut what really irks me is burning wood pellets , cutting trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into wood pellets , and then putting on a ship and having them burnt in the UK to produce electricity .\nAnd this is a big part of the UK \u2019 s claim to be producing renewable energy \u2013 does this make any environmental sense ?\nAnd so we have given birth to a whole lot of nonsensical policies .\nWind and solar are niche solutions .\nSmall modular nuclear reactors seem to be far and away the best solution , at least on the near term horizon .\nWe \u2019 re just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the time scale of 10 years , they should be very common .\nThere may be other better sources that come down the pike .\nIt takes a certain amount of time to develop prototypes , but scaling up and taking it to market and the infrastructure and whatever all takes time .\nSo I think in the near term , the , the small modular nuclear reactors are the best solution for the next decade , but even going to natural gas , converting from coal to natural gas , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help .\nWhen I look at wind and solar if I were an investor or a leader of a country \u2013 the value proposition just isn \u2019 t there yet .\nAnd it doesn \u2019 t mean that it can \u2019 t get there at some point .\nBut right now , if I \u2019 m struggling with energy security , those forms of energy like wind or hydroelectricity , or have good sun exposure \u2013 coal makes sense .\nBut I want it to follow up with that because again , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these folks who emailed me are fringe , but there were individuals who said , \u201c Judith Curry is connected to the fossil fuel industry .\nAnd she \u2019 s a renegade that \u2019 s been disproven !\n\u201d My company has some clients in the energy sector , here are some examples .\nWe make hurricane forecasts for electricity providers in Florida , so they can figure out when a storm is coming so they can prepare and and do their best to bring electricity back up quickly .\nMy oldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petroleum company .\nAnd my involvement with them is for natural gas trading .\nThis began about 15 years to go to help stabilize natural gas prices , following hurricane Katrina and all that mess in the Gulf of Mexico and the natural gas prices skyrocketed .\nMy company also provides temperature forecasts to support natural gas trading , but the biggest , the growing part of the natural gas trading is forecasts of wind power .\nAnd to a lesser extent , solar power .\nForecasts of wind and solar power are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intermittent .\nKnowing when the wind is going to blow or the sun isn \u2019 t going to shine makes a big difference in how much natural gas you need to buy for backup .\nSo all of this supports having adequate natural gas supply in the face of these intermittences and keeping the price stabilized .\nSo how is that evil ?\nI \u2019 m not exactly sure .\nMy climate research is not supported by fossil fuel companies .\nSome energy companies are customers for my companies weather forecast products ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my company ) .\nSo how this puts me in bed with with fossil fuel companies , I don \u2019 t know .\nAny weather company or meteorologist in the private sector is dealing with energy companies .\nThey \u2019 re the biggest single consumer of weather information .\nSo that is my involvement with energy companies .\nAnd that \u2019 s the very disgusting part of the climate science space .\nIt \u2019 s that , that smearing , that divisiveness takes us away from the real , like you said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then you see the ramifications of not focusing on that .\nNot making the connection that somehow governments are looking at this and not thinking about infrastructure development , because I \u2019 m sure they are .\nBut if there was as much focus on that than there are on emissions reductions , you just wonder\u2026 All the money and effort that we \u2019 ve spent on renewables could have been used to improve the electricity transmission grid , and reduce our vulnerability to extreme weather events , which are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have this idea , I was talking to a friend of mine who \u2019 s big on electric vehicles .\nAnd I said to that person , I said , wouldn \u2019 t it be kinda neat if we just kept focusing on making the gas powered engine way more efficient getting a thousand kilometers out of a single tank of gas instead of just jumping into an electric vehicle where we still don \u2019 t really know all the risks with the technology as yet ?\nWhereas with the gas powered engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus years .\nWhy don \u2019 t we just make that more efficient ?\nI mean , doesn \u2019 t it produce more heat than anything else , I don \u2019 t know .\nWell , I don \u2019 t know how much more efficient they can be made , but I like hybrid vehicles because the batteries are simpler .\nSo I think the hybrid vehicles are a good intermediate solution .\nAnd the other issue too , everybody gets excited about electric vehicles , which are going to double , triple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWind and solar alone aren \u2019 t going to cut it .\nWe will need much , much more electricity , Bitcoin and and who knows what else will emerge .\nElectricity is key to innovation and prosperity , so we want as much of it as we can get .\nWhat are your thoughts on COP26 and is the outcome what you anticipated ?\nSo for me , looking at it , making a global climate change agreement is exceptionally challenging and it lends itself to nothing too specific .\nWhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change agreements all together ?\nDo you think that they \u2019 re kind of they \u2019 re that they \u2019 re , I wouldn \u2019 t say pointless .\nBut that it just shows a commitment from the global community towards climate change ?\nWell , I think Greta nailed it with her blah , blah , blah .\nThere \u2019 ve been a lot of these COPs .\nIt \u2019 s mostly hot air .\nAnd the thing that really irks me is all these \u2018 important people \u2019 flying in on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas-powered big limos and whatever .\nExcuse me , can you please walk the talk at least in some superficial way ?\nCOP26 looked like this big opulent blow out , and and here they \u2019 re telling all these developing countries , we \u2019 re not going to let you develop grid electricity and fossil fuel power plants .\nIt was hypocrisy , at its finest .\nBut all of these promises are really political games .\nAt the end of the day , very few countries are going to sacrifice their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few European countries seem inclined to , but most of the others don \u2019 t no matter what they say .\nThe US is an interesting microcosm because in the absence of a very stringent federal policy , you have the different states going in different directions .\nOn one hand you have California .\nThey \u2019 re going full force to wind and solar and shutting down their last nuclear power plant .\nAnd , the electricity prices are sky high with outages and on and on it goes , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And people are leaving California in droves .\nWe \u2019 re seeing a few states that are in the Northeast that want to follow in California \u2019 s footsteps .\nAnd then you have other states that want to keep burning coal.And then in Northern Minnesota where they do all the iron ore smelting and all the really big , big , heavy industry stuff , I mean , coal is really the best fuel for that .\nSo it \u2019 s hard to get them off coal also .\nAt the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong for the UN to ask countries to stop , burning fossil fuels when there aren \u2019 t any obvious alternatives for them , or if they don \u2019 t have enough electricity already , it \u2019 s just , it \u2019 s just not right .\nAlso , the actual level of alarm over global warming has dropped a lot .\nWe used to hear five degrees centigrade , four degrees , crazy , horrible , scary stuff .\nOkay .\nNow with the AR6 , with the medium emissions scenario , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrees centigrade .\nAnd this is 2.9 degrees since pre-industrial times .\nSo it \u2019 s really , we \u2019 ve already warmed 1.2 .\nSo we \u2019 re already halfway there with no particularly dire results .\nAnd then actually according to the International Energy Agencies , our emissions are coming in lower than the IPCC medium emission scenario .\nThe estimates are now like maybe 2.6 degrees is the business as usual .\nAnd then if you put in everybody \u2019 s promises , that goes down to 2.2 and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then it \u2019 s down to 1.8 degrees .\nNot meeting the made up target of 1.5 degrees is deemed to be code red for humanity , but how meaningful are these targets ?\nThese timelines totally ignore natural climate variability .\nIt looks like all the modes of natural climate variability are tilted towards cooling over the next three decades .\nIt looks like we \u2019 re heading towards a solar minimum .\nAny volcanic eruptions by definition are negative .\nAnd we expect the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation to shift to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a decade .\nSo all of these modes of natural variability point to cooling in the coming decades , which would push these off by decades .\nThis buys us decades to figure out what we should do .\nSo we \u2019 re talking about less than one degree of additional warming , it doesn \u2019 t sound so scary when you put it that way .\nWhat are your thoughts on environment and corporate social governance ?\nIf ESG is this new term that \u2019 s floating out there especially in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directing their investments to companies that already have some type of environment or social governance policy or platform to their line of work .\nNow just as an individual , I \u2019 m concerned about that because I always think , well , there \u2019 s no real way to audit a company on their environment or environmental , social governance .\nAnd I worry that a lot of money is going into this space now , similar to sole sourcing windmill development to one company and signing up large government contracts .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ there \u2019 s a lot of money on the table that \u2019 s dedicated to this .\nAnd again , as a layman investor , I would say , well , show me your assets , show me your liabilities .\nAnd I can tell you if you \u2019 re profitable or not , I \u2019 m concerned about this .\nCause it could kind of in a way , inflate an entire sector without really looking at its profitability ?\nThose people might very well end up losing money because those might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the timescale of a decade .\nThere \u2019 s a lot of greenwashing going on .\nPeople who are voting with their politics and their green conscience are becoming people who are voting with their wallet , we \u2019 ll see who wins financially .\nThe same thing is going on with property along the coast in the US .\nEvery one is alarmed about sea level rise , and then President Obama just bought a big mansion at Martha \u2019 s Vineyard , right on the coast .\nLike , how worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At some point , there \u2019 ll be Republican and Democrat neighborhoods , the Democrats won \u2019 t buy houses on the coast and the Republicans or the climate deniers will .\nAnd who \u2019 s going to make money out of these deals , and will there be net benefits or disasters to living on the coast ?\nWe \u2019 ll see .\nMany people have overinflated the financial risk of all this .\nThe scientists who prepared the socioeconomic pathways and the emission scenarios have stated that by 2100 , everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , at least on average , even for the highest emissions scenarios .\nSo why are we , doing all this now \u2013 our grandchildren who will be better off than we are .\nWe have a fairly naive understanding of the risks we \u2019 re actually facing in the 21st century .\nClimate policy could end up being like treating a head cold with chemotherapy , while when the real medical problem is something very different .\nAnd by putting so much resources into an ineffective solution for climate change , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have for all our threats , and we could overall end up more vulnerable as a result of this exercise .\nAnd I think about everything that we \u2019 ve talked about , and I think about elections in the United States and around the world and this Canada went through its own election here in September .\nAnd it seems like there \u2019 s this blind adoption of , we must do something for climate change .\nAnd we \u2019 re going to sign on to every international agreement and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States to these record low emissions levels , but it \u2019 s less sexier to talk about , well , guess what , we also built up our water waste management in , Northern Alberta , or other parts of Canada and the United States .\nAnd so I wonder , is all this too far gone ?\nCan we elect politicians now and leaders of countries that want to revert back to evidence-based discussions and less on the political platitudes ?\nOh , but the science is \u2018 settled \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so brainwashed about global warming that there \u2019 s only one thing that \u2019 s going to change it .\nif I \u2019 m right about natural variability having sort of a cooling effect in the coming decades , this will be the one piece of evidence that people will have to pay attention to .\nIf that transpires , I would say that would be the single most effective thing at bringing this dialogue back to some level of rationality , but how much confidence do I have in that prediction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bet on that ?\nI don \u2019 t know , but it \u2019 s a very plausible scenario that natural variability will lead to cooling in the coming decades , or at least slow down the warming .\nSo we \u2019 ll see if that transpires .\nIf it does , that would be the single most effective thing at bringing the dialogue back to normal in some sensible way , so people look at this problem more broadly .\nOn the current path , we are not managing this risk in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries stronger and less vulnerable to whatever my transpire in the future .\nAnd I think voices like yourself and those that are advocating for more sensibility when it comes to energy security too , it \u2019 s , it \u2019 s very , very appealing to talk about wind and solar .\nIt \u2019 s less appealing to say coal is not a choice .\nIt \u2019 s a necessity for some countries in some regions and it \u2019 s not that these regions don \u2019 t want cleaner energy .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t gotten to that point yet for that area .\nAnd so I think that \u2019 s why I \u2019 m so thankful that you \u2019 ve agreed to come back on here and talk for a second time .", "author": "curryja", "url":

traveled more than 200 miles , and more than 100 people may have died .\nAn excellent overview of the storm was written by Bob Henson [ link ] .\nPreliminary analysis indicates that the maximum tornado strength was EF4 , with winds estimated as high as 190 mph .\nThe links between tornadoes and climate change are more nuanced than for phenomena such as heat waves or extreme rainfall .\nFortunately , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most violent tornadoes ( EF3+ ) is increasing .\nHowever , tornadoes are becoming more tightly packed within outbreaks , and there are longer stretches in between , leading to more variability from quiet to violent periods and vice versa .\nPrior to Friday , the U.S. tornado death toll for 2021 was only 14 , the third lowest in data going back to 1875 .\n( The lowest on record was 10 , set in 2018 . )\nThere \u2019 s also been a distinct multi-decadal trend for recent outbreaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi Valley , particularly over the Mid-South , as opposed to the more traditional territory of the southern and central Great Plains .\nAs for seasonal timing , it \u2019 s never been impossible to get a violent tornado in December , even as far north as Illinois .\nAt least two F5/EF5 tornadoes are on the record books for December : one in Vicksburg , Mississippi on Dec. 5 , 1953 , that killed 38 ( the deadliest December tornado on record up to this year ) , and one on Dec. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Illinois , as part of the state \u2019 s most severe outbreak on record so late in the year .\nThis December has been strikingly mild across most of the United States , and warm , moist surface air streamed into Friday \u2019 s tornadic storms , fueling their power .\nIt \u2019 s not hard to imagine the springtime peak and the autumn second-season peak of tornado season edging closer to winter as greenhouse gases continue to warm our climate globally , nationally , and regionally .\nSuch a shift in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus far , though .\nWhat does

these statements in an interview : Q Mr. President , does this say anything to you about climate change ?\nIs this \u2014 or do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensity has to do with climate change ?\nTHE PRESIDENT : Well , all that I know is that the intensity of the weather across the board has some impact as a consequence of the warming of the planet and the climate change .\nThe specific impact on these specific storms , I can \u2019 t say at this point .\nI \u2019 m going to be asking the EPA and others to take a look at that .\nBut the fact is that we all know everything is more intense when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , obviously , it has some impact here , but I can \u2019 t give you a \u2014 a quantitative read on that .\nHere is what Michael Mann has to say [ link ] : Meteorologist Michael Mann of

plots of December tornadoes from NOAA data : The US FEMA administrator says December tornadoes are the \u2018 new normal \u2019 [ link ] .\nIt seems that 1963 is the only year on record with no US tornadoes during December .\nWith regards to normalized U.S. damage from tornadoes , Roger Pielke Jr provides this graph [ link ] : Historical data of tornado events in USA is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in observational techniques affecting reliability and consistency of reporting .\nIPCC SREX claims : \u201c There is low confidence in observed trends in small spatial-scale phenomena such as tornadoes and hail because of data inhomogeneities and inadequacies in monitoring systems.\n\u201d One of the main factors in such inhomogeneity was the development and deployment of Doppler RADAR starting in the mid 1980s , though deployment is an ongoing process in the decades since .\nOther factors are the spread of urbanised areas into rural areas and facility of reporting by non technical persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to global communications .\nRADAR observations record many smaller events which would not have been seen or recorded previously .\nHistorically , many events were recorded by insurance claims when they affected property or crops and this meant many minor events would go unreported unless they caused injury or significant damage .\nHowever large , powerful events are unlikely to be missed .\nTornadoes are classed according to the Enhanced Fujita Scale ( EF Scale ) .\nExamination of the available data from 1950 to end 2019 shows more powerful events ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progression over time and it is just the lower magnitude EF0 and EF1 which are boosted in recent years by better , more comprehensive reporting .\nThe archive of individual tornado events lists each event by date and provides several data such as location , force rating and fatalities .\nThe number of events of each force rating in each calendar year were calculated , then each time series was standardised ( subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation ) to see the relative progression of each category over time .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1975 , there was a marked reduction in tornado activity in all categories .\nWith the exception of a few lesser peaks , activity remained below average ever since .\nEF2 , EF3 and EF4 categories all show very similar progression over time in both individual years of activity and long term trends .\nIt is very unlikely that massive tornadoes would go unnoticed and unreported , so the similarity in the temporal evolution of each category indicates that reporting , down to EF2 is consistent over time .\nThe data are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which gives confidence that there are no major reporting induced biases present .\nThe period from 1950 \u2013 1975 shows a steadily rising level of activity reaching a climax in 1975 .\nAfter that there was a sudden and marked decline with no sign of a reversing increase since .\nAll three categories are strikingly similar , which indicates there is no tendency towards a greater proportion of more power or less powerful storms over this period .\nThe post 1975 period marks the beginning of the late 20th century warming which IPCC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AGW ) .\nIf there is a need to hypothesise a link between \u201c global warming \u201d and the frequency or intensity of tornadoes in USA , it would be that there have been less events in all major categories during this warming period .\nThere has been no significant change in the distribution in storm severity as temperatures rise and recent warmer decades have seen notably less activity than the earlier post-WWII cooling period .\nMarshall Shepherd wrote a good article in Forbes entitled How Climate Messaging Spun Out Of Control During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that climate change is being discussed with greater vigor .\nThe bad news is that some of that discussion is cringe-worthy .\nRecent tornado outbreaks sparked a frenzy of coverage about connections to climate change .\nIn my view , some of the messaging spun out of control .\nI reached out to Professor Allen for his thoughts on messaging in the aftermath of the December tornadoes .\nThe Central Michigan University scholar told me , \u201c There is a philosophical point where I think we have to be careful to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when agreeing to interviews.\n\u201d I am a scientist who receives media requests frequently .\nThere are so many media outlets these days that content is at a premium and so are \u201c talking heads.\n\u201d Relative to the audience , I probably can speak to a range of weather , climate , and Earth science topics .\nThough my degrees are in meteorology , I get asked about wildfires , tsunamis , meteors , and other basic topics , and it is usually ok .\nHowever , we all have limits .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ While we might be able to talk about other fields at a basic level , for most of the science ( particularly regarding climate change ) , it is often the nuance which defines what we are able to say \u2013 and familiarity with the latest developments in the field tends to be where this is exposed most.\n\u201d Such nuances can be even more challenging for an \u201c expert \u201d speaking without firm meteorological or climate science grounding .\nExpert saturation is another problem .\nIn the midst of events like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ input from experts .\nMany of the experts become overwhelmed by the requests .\nIt is a double-edged sword .\nScholars like Trapp , Brooks , Gensini , and Allen have achieved a certain level of credibility and become \u201c go to \u201d sources .\nHowever , when the expert pool \u201c saturates , \u201d there can be a tendency to move to other options .\nOften , those options are mostly just fine .\nHowever , some choices end up being cringe-inducing .\nProfessor Victor Gensini , an expert at Northern Illinois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real .\nHe has done over 50 interviews in the past week and referred 30 others .\nHe wrote , \u201c Honestly , I share a very similar sentiment to you\u2026.I think the real issues arise when \u2018 fringe field \u2019 experts come in and try to apply their perspective and research to the question of the day.\n\u201d At the end of the day , there are multiple messages and messengers out there .\nThis is not going to change .\nHow can we deal with conflicting narratives in real-time , poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the saturation problem .\nI am not sure .", "author": "curryja", "url": "https://judithcurry.com/2021/12/16/tornado/", "published": "Thu, 16

woke-babies and the insane focus on victimhood , intersectionality , gender and diversity at the expense of traditional academic values has made many universities pretty dysfunctional and even scary places .\nWithin politics and popular culture , cancel culture has also run amok .\nThe heroine in all this has to be J.K.
