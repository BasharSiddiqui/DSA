scientists have been working diligently for years on bringing them back .\nIn 2019 , Japanese researchers made a breakthrough using 28,000-year-old DNA from Yuka , a perfectly preserved baby mammoth

Nelson Pushes for Scientific UFO Research 1 Month into Office", "content": "Bill Nelson , 78 , the former Florida senator and spaceflight veteran , became the NASA Administrator on May 3 , 2021 .\nOne month later , Bill Nelson has directed NASA to study UFOS ( or UAPs ) .\nNotably , the push comes as a much-anticipated UAP report is due to Congress .\nIn 1986 , Nelson flew on the 24th flight of the Space Shuttle Columbia , conducting 12 medical experiments .\nDuring a CNN interview with Rachel Crane , Nelson claimed that NASA doesn \u2019 t know what the authentic UFOs observed by Navy pilots and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s quickly leading scientific efforts into the phenomena .\n\u201c Well , I have talked to those Navy pilots , and they are sure that they saw something real , \u201d said Nelson .\n\u201c And of course , we \u2019 ve seen the video from their jets .\nWhat is it ?\nWe don \u2019 t know .\nSo , now that I \u2019 m here at NASA , I \u2019 ve turned to our scientists , and I \u2019 ve said , \u201c Would you , looking at it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can determine so that we can have a better idea ?\n\u201d Leading with science and evidence is also how former Nevada senator Harry Reid proposes approaching UFO research .\nIn a recent op-ed in the Times , Reid , the man who created the clandestine Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program ( AATIP ) , wrote : Now , NASA could have more funds for scientific inquiry .\nIn the budget for 2022 , President Biden has requested a 6.6 % increase for NASA science .\nAlthough Bill Nelson is pushing for scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Nelson \u201c did not establish a formal task force , \u201d per CNN .\nInterestingly , McGuinness cited American \u2019 s interest in the subject as a reason why NASA scientists are taking a new approach .\nIn response to the news about NASA , former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Christopher Mellon called the news \u201c wonderful and unexpected news of scientific open-mindedness.\n\u201d Then , he notes \u201c potential \u201d for NASA \u2019 s collaboration with the Intelligence Community .\nWhen Rachel Crane asked Bill Nelson , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @

doesn \u2019 t know if it \u2019 s ETs , an enemy , or an optical phenomenon .\nThen , Crane pushed again , asking Nelson directly , \u201c What do you think it is ?\nWhat \u2019 s your personal take on it ?\n\u201d \u201c What have they said to you ?\n\u201d asked Crane .\nThen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be working directly with the Pentagon on the upcoming UAP report but said , \u201c I can guarantee you

reportedly has few personnel or resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looks like NASA is not directly contributing to the public report , a notable omission , although they are seeing a budget increase .\nHopefully , there is potential for a collaboration sometime in the future , as Mellon suggests ?\nRight now , it doesn \u2019 t seem to be happening \u2013 at least not publicly .\nFor those who

abilities .\nIn 2008 , Luiz Elizondo was first detailed to the secret UFO program sponsored by Senator Harry Reid , then called the Advanced Aerospace Weapon Systems Applications Program .\nLater , it

there is a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response , Mellon discussed the frustration Elizondo faced in AATIP .\nAs pilots on the East coast saw UFOs frequently , Elizondo \u2019 s program was low on resources and

multiple current and former government officials say military and spy agencies are \u201c blocking or simply ignoring the effort , \u201d reported POLITICO .\nSen. Marco Rubio requested the UAP report , which is required to provide \u201c a detailed description \u201d of all unidentified aerial phenomena reporting for the federal government , \u201c regardless of which service or agency acquired the information.\n\u201d Nevertheless , it seems the report will likely be incomplete , delayed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent CIA document dump .\nNow , the Biden administration may decide to delay the report due to all the roadblocks .\nIn all likelihood , delaying the forthcoming report would only strengthen the public \u2019 s perception of a coverup .\nSuch perception would be entirely logical , given the long history of coverups , such as the decades of secret multimillion-dollar UFO study programs .\nAlso , recent public statements by Trump \u2019 s former Director of National Intelligence ( DNI ) John Ratcliffe make it clear there may be much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFor example , Ratcliffe said , \u201c there are a lot more sightings \u201d than the

.\nDespite Rubio \u2019 s request , it \u2019 s plain that the Pentagon maintains the position that protecting national security takes precedence over public disclosure .\nThus , the Air Force deferred reporters \u2019 questions to the Office of the Secretary of Defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responded without addressing criticism : From this statement , we can assume any report would redact UAP details .\nAlready , Rubio has asked fellow lawmakers to take the report seriously on 60 Minutes .\nFurther , Rubio acknowledged a stigma about the subject .\nNow , consider that some in Congress may giggle at the mere mention of UFOs and that the report will almost certainly be incomplete .\nAs for us , we gave up a long time ago on seeing many in Congress take issues seriously .\nAccording to former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christopher Mellon , the Air Force has denied access to information .\nAlso , a Navy-led Pentagon task force set up last August has few personnel or resources to gather any evidence .\nFurther , government bureaucracies are stymying the efforts , as one would expect .\nOn the other hand , Mellon notes that , in contrast , the \u201c tide is turning against the illogical stigma \u201d preventing objective UAP study .\nWhistleblower and former AATIP leader Luis \u201c Lue \u201d Elizondo , who now works with Mellon and other former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Arts and Sciences , says delaying the June UAP report might be the best outcome .\nInstead , an interim report using more time and resources would serve the public better .\nRecently , Elizondo tweeted that he does not think the recent sightings could be attributed only to drones .\nIn a 60 Minutes interview , Elizondo says that while the government has confirmed the UFOs are real , it has also been covering up the truth .\nSee Elizondo in the clip from Inside Edition : Even as decades of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainstream UFO acceptance , it \u2019 s clear that full disclosure at this time would be extremely unlikely .\nAlready , we can see that the June UAP report will withhold much from the public .\nAs Mellon said , even getting government agencies to agree on the language used will prove challenging .\nTherefore , we can all plan to continue searching for the truth after the UAP report comes out .\nIn all likelihood , the prevailing attitudes of stigma and secrecy will not just vanish like a UFO .\nIndeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades to discourage interest in the subject .\nFor an in-depth analysis of how it was done , see the recent piece by Gideon Lewis-Kraus in the New Yorker . )\nOn the other

.\nBy obtaining genes from neighboring plants , they become adaptable , grow faster and stronger .\nSomehow , the grasses can even take advantage of specific genes .\nHowever , scientists don \u2019 t

.\nFortunately , the grasses in the study are those humans depend on most for food : wheat , maize , rice , and barley .\nBy studying how the plants naturally change , scientists hope we can apply it to naturally modify crops .\nIn particular , grasses with a rhizome appear more likely to engage in gene swapping .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ underground like a root that stores nutrients .\nAlong the rhizome , nodes can send new roots down into the soil .\nUnfortunately , many plants with rhizomes are invasive , and part of a rhizome can grow a new plant asexually ( including poison ivy ) .\nAs the University of Sheffield researchers point out , grass doesn \u2019 t fit traditional Darwinian evolution .\nRather than pass genes from parent to offspring , grass can \u201c steal genes \u201d from

, we are hardwired to want to go back , even in its current desolate form .\nAlthough things look bleak , nothing will stop us from getting to Mars .\nSome 4 billion years ago , Mars was more Earth-like , but it lost its magnetic field for unknown reasons .\nThen , the solar winds stripped the planet of its atmosphere .\nTo escape , perhaps life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organic molecules on Martian meteorites .\nRemarkably , there might be a physiological sign that Mars could be our original homeworld .\nThus , Bara suggests it \u2019 s evidence humans going to Mars may be returning there after

security chief for 30 years , claimed a secret underground base on Mars exists .\nThere , American astronauts and ETs work together and have for years .\nOf course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy immediately , but we remain open-minded .\nAfter all , mainstream news is now routinely reporting on authentic UFOs .\nLong , Ago , Eshed claims that the US government signed an agreement with extraterrestrials .\nIf so , it might coincide with the stories about President Eisenhower in the mid-50s .\nAccording to Philip Schneider , a structural engineer with a high-level security clearance , Eisenhower made a pact with three alien species .\n( Schneider later died under highly suspicious circumstances . )\nRegardless of whether these stories are true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitable .\nAccording to Nick Pope , former UFO investigator for the UK Ministry of Defence : As humans venture out into space , we \u2019 ll need a base .\nCertainly , it \u2019 s common sense that humans would need a base , and what would be better than our closest neighboring planet ?\nSimilarly , former Air Force weather observer and contactee Charles Jame Hall claims there has long been an agreement with the government and

it will the first time NASA astronauts will walk on the Moon since 1972 .\nEventually , NASA hopes to fly people as well as supplies and materials to the Moon and beyond .\nEffectively , NASA shifted

.\nIf Elon Musk has his way , the planet could be warmed by exploding nuclear bombs over the Martian polar ice caps .\nThen , the radiation created would escape into space , he suggests.\n?\nOne almost sees a pattern of recklessness .\nOtherwise , scientists have ideas to redirect comets or asteroids to hit Mars .\nSo , maybe it \u2019 s not so crazy ?\nFor ancient astronaut theorists , such an idea may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s past .\nIn short , Mars \u2019 current state is the opposite of Earth today .\nWhile we have too much carbon dioxide due to our activities , the Red Planet doesn \u2019 t have nearly enough to create beneficial global warming .\nIt \u2019 s too bad we can \u2019 t export our excess CO2 to Mars , though it still wouldn \u2019 t be nearly enough .\nCurrently , NASA \u2019 s Perseverance Rover \u2019 s MOXIE experiment aims to change what little CO2 there is on Mars to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so small , a more feasible plan may be to export oxygen-creating extremophile microorganisms from Earth .\nSome 2.5 billion years ago , it was similar cyanobacteria that created our oxygen-rich atmosphere .\nUnfortunately , NASA determined in 1976 that using microorganisms to create a breathable atmosphere might take thousands of years .\nMoreover , since Mars has lost its magnetic field , it would be a lost cause anyway .\nTherefore , the first problem is fixing Mar \u2019 s magnetic field .\nBut how ?\nInterestingly , according to the Planetary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can already place a weak field at the stable Sun-Mars L1 Lagrange point .\n( 2,000 Gauss ) So , if they can figure out how to make the magnetic field stronger ( more like 10,000 Gauss ) , it could work .\nAgain , talk about saving the Martian atmosphere harkens back to the ancient astronaut theory .\nTo save the atmosphere on their home planet , the Anunnaki came to Earth to mine for gold .\nThen , they used the gold in some unknown way to protect their atmosphere .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnetic field ?\nMaybe it \u2019 s not so far-fetched after all ?\nSee more about Lagrange points from Spacedock : If all went well , then Mars might become more Earth-like again .\nHowever , due to the lower gravity , conditions would likely be similar to living in the Himalayan mountains .\nThink : cold with thin , oxygen-low air .\nInterestingly , there are signs of lost ancient cultures in the Himalayas here on Earth .\nLikewise , Martian conditions in the higher altitudes of Chile seem to coincide with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe , the ETs found conditions there just perfect .\nConsidering everything , it seems like a better bet to restore the environment here on the Blue Planet before we head on over to the Red one .\nNevertheless , seeing astronauts on Mars seems inevitable in our quest to find other life in the universe .\nAs when we arrived on the Moon , humans will become the extraterrestrials , if not Martians returning home .", "author": "Ancient

under a giant White Pine tree .\nAfterward , a governing Great Council of chiefs began meeting together in a longhouse .\nBy oral tradition , the leaders planted a white pine after founding the Great Law of Peace .\nToday , this practice of planting peace trees continues .\nFor example , in 1988 , Jake Swamp , a Mohawk chief of the Iroquois Grand Council , planted a pine that stands near the @ @ @

For example , watching politicians talk , one gets the idea that malevolent reptilians may be in government positions today .\nAt this point , who would be surprised ?\nBut seriously , it goes back to our ancient past , when humans and reptiles shared a common ancestor .\nToday , there are thousands of venomous animals , both reptiles and a few mammals .\nFor example , shrews and some moles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mammals have venom that is watery , dilute , and profuse .\nAfter the scientists studied thousands of genes associated with venom production , they discovered that the same genes and physical mechanisms were at work in saliva glands and venom glands .\nSo , while humans currently don \u2019 t secrete venomous proteins , in time , we could do so .\nHowever , snakes are far more highly evolved in that regard , with potent venom used sparingly .\nEven without venom , a human bite is dangerous , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a child .\nThe Mayo Clinic states a human bite may be more dangerous than an animal bite due to bacteria and viruses always present in our mouths .\nOften , people bitten by a person will require a tetanus shot .\nSo , the need to evolve venom seems a redundant step .\nOn the other hand , there are ample ancient stories of human-snake hybrids , and the word \u201c venom \u201d may be derived from Venus , the Roman goddess of love .\n( Greek Aphrodite ) Her charms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Latin venemum , meaning \u201c magical charm , potent drug , \u201d later became \u201c deadly substance , poison.\n\u201d As we all know well , some may already be poisonous in the

into their fossilized remains .\nIt all goes back to our mammalian ancestry .\nThus , Neanderthals once hibernated alongside cave bears to avoid harsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t mean they were particularly good at hibernation , as evidence by signs of seasonal malnutrition and disease .\nToday , doctors can induce a state of torpor while patients undergo surgery .\nIn the future , our capacity to hibernate

monoliths appearing all over the place .\nWe Owe Our Spines to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humans are distantly related to other species , it makes you wonder what other traits we could evolve ?\nAfter all , we have many distant relatives .\nGoing back further , we trace our ancestry to creatures lurking in the oceans .\nSome people owe their spines to these creatures , while other people are apparently still working on it .\nYou just know it \u2019 s the spineless folks who are more likely to become venomous .\nMillions of years ago , creatures that looked like the Roomba of the seas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom-dwelling fish called osteostracans ( meaning \u201c bony shields \u201d ) gulped mud with no jaws some 400 million years ago .\nInside , they had a primitive bony internal endoskeleton

a year of hiding from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling .\nPerhaps , we can emerge into a new year of possibilities , heralded by the appearance of monoliths worldwide .\nFor example , consider what it truly means if traversable wormholes are real with your imagination .\nOpening Up a Can of Wormholes For years , mainstream scientists have suggested that if wormholes are possible , they would be

@ @ Scientific American .\nBy 2019 , The New York Times reported that scientists from China proposed a way to test if gravity could travel by wormholes .\nBy studying black holes and compact stars near them , they hoped to find signs gravity was leaking through , tugging objects on the far side of a wormhole .\nRecently , in March 2021 , Popular Mechanics shared the news : \u201c Human-Safe Wormholes Could Exist in the Real World , Study Finds.\n\u201d International researchers published two new studies suggesting ways to prevent wormholes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go through unharmed .\nTheorists had suggested one way would be to \u201c fill the wormhole with an exotic form of matter that has negative mass.\n\u201d However , such matter , as far as we know , hasn \u2019 t been found .\nInstead , the researchers suggested , \u201c a wormhole that forms in five-dimensional spacetime also known as the Randall-Sundrum model.\n\u201d So long as the wormhole remained clear of stray particles , people could theoretically go in them .\nIn other words , you go first because any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you survived the trip , you could cross the galaxy in less than a second .\nOn the

arrangement of wires and electric current .\nBut , perhaps one day they will find out how to manipulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe they could discover how to generate a wormhole .\nIf wormholes allow beings from thousands of years in the past to emerge into the present , what would we see ?\nPerhaps , we might see a plesiosaur swimming in Loch Ness , for example ?\nThat \u2019 s precisely what

mass-negative region of spacetime .\nIf the unique Loch could open a porthole , would it allow ancient creatures or UFOs to emerge from a different time or galaxy ?\nWould that explain why people keep seeing a dinosaur swimming in the murky waters ?\nAcross the ocean in Lake Champlain , people see Champ , another plesiosaur-like creature .\nThe Abenaki and the Iroquois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the serpent-like creature .\nThe Abenaki name it the Gitaskog .\nWhen Europeans arrived , sightings continued until modern times .\nIn 1977 , Sandra Mansi took a photo of Champ , which looks unmistakably

connected the lakes , allowing sightings of the same creatures .\nPerhaps the animals remain elusive because they exist only momentarily , like a snapshot into the ancient past .\nIf we put aside skepticism for a moment , could similar anomalous zones and bizarre sightings be connected to transient wormholes ?\nPerhaps they are only possible under certain circumstances , such as where energy fields are channeled in a particular way ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more common than we know ?\nIf so , could we apply that concept to boat and airplane disappearances in the Bermuda Triangle ?\nCould other mysterious sightings of UFOs and alien creatures be connected to wormholes ?\nFor that matter , could it explain the sightings of apparitions also ?\nWhat other places on the planet might there be areas where energy fields could open wormholes ?\nPerhaps , the ancient pyramids of Egypt ?\nLike the Loch , the pyramid and many ancient standing stones have high levels of quartz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granite , which can be up to 60 % quartz .\nWere such locations portholes as many Ancient Astronaut theorists and the Outlander series suggest ?\nIt \u2019 s outlandish to consider , but also not impossible .\nReports of time dilation and inter-dimensional gateways have been reported in various human-made structures like the Woolwich Foot Tunnel Anomaly in London .\nMeanwhile , in declassified
