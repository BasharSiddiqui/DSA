more from there to get your destiny number .\nYes , it \u2019 s that simple .\nFor instance , if your birthday is 01/06/1995 you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month , and then the year .\n1 + 9 + 9 + 5 = 24 and from there reducing the 24 to 2 + 4 = 6 .\nNow we have 1 + 6 + 6 = 13 and are in need of reducing once more .\nThis meaning the person with this birthday \u2019 s destiny number is 4 .\nThat wasn \u2019 t too hard now was it ?\nNow , your destiny number is always going to be between one and 9 so if you have anything higher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anymore .\nOnce you have your destiny number present

as of today two planets have moved into different signs thus bringing about an entirely new mood .\nAs of January 8th , Mercury is now in the sign Aquarius , and Venus is now in the sign Capricorn .\nWhile both of these things might sound small , they are very interesting and important to be aware of .\nBecause of this kind of shift , we are able to really allow things to take hold in our lives .\nMercury will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will station retrograde there at the end of the month on the 30th .\nVenus on the other hand will be entering Aquarius on February 1st without having retrograded at all .\nWhen Mercury is in Aquarius we are offered a much more progressive approach to things and for that , we should be thankful .\nTarot.com wrote as follows on some of the energies Mercury in Aquarius can offer : Aquarius is about remaining neutral and not letting our feelings get in the way of the truth .\nSo when Mercury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we \u2019 ll have the opportunity to view the things we \u2019 re emotionally invested in through a more rational lens .\nThis approach could finally help us see people and situations for what they really are .\nExpect a few \u201c a-ha \u201d moments courtesy of this dynamic duo !\nThe one thing to watch out for during Mercury \u2019 s time in this sign is hurting or neglecting other people \u2019 s feelings .\nThe cerebral nature of Mercury in Aquarius can overpower emotions and rationalize them away , making it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible that we \u2019 ll lose touch with our sensitive sides , so we need to do our best to handle any conversations we have during this time with care .\nNow , in regard to its retrograde which we noted was going to be happening , we should also keep in mind that this planet can and will bring on a bit of chaos .\nWe may find that becoming frustrated is much quicker in our lives and that we need to rethink things more deeply than we typically would have before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAgain , I know , this might not sound like much but please keep these things in mind as you move forward .\nNow , Venus in Capricorn holds its own energies as well but they are not nearly as complex as those of Mercury in Aquarius as far as I am concerned .\nHowever , that does not mean they are unimportant when it comes to understanding what you \u2019 re facing as a whole .\nWhen Venus is in Capricorn we are able to really dive into things more deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how to go about getting exactly that .\nThe energies this ordeal brings forth are very progressive and full of change .\nThe planet Venus is one that deals in the world of love a lot as well so it holds heavy influence there .\nOverall , if you want to get something done putting your eggs in the right baskets during this time will matter more than most could ever imagine .\nWhat do you think about all of this ?\nI know , it might sound a bit out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s happening in the celestial world the more we understand about what we are going through within .\nThis kind of thing is not a joke .", "author": "Gerald Sinclair", "url":

Control", "content": "While not everyone will admit this , the silent treatment is a form of abuse .\nWhen people use this against you , they do it with the intent of getting you to give in to what they are wanting and well , that is NOT okay .\nFor those who might not be aware , the silent treatment is something that people do when you \u2019 re refusing to do something they want or perhaps

wrote as follows on this topic : Experiencing the silent treatment denies basic human social and relationship needs .\nThe silent treatment has been known to end romantic relationships , alienate friends , and negatively impact child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment from parents or caregivers , the effects can be devastating .\nSome evidence suggests women may respond differently to the silent treatment than men .\nFor example , a study of workplace collaboration shows women were more likely to compensate or attempt to become even more proactive and communicative when ostracized from a group project , whereas men were more likely to give up or \u201c loaf.\n\u201d People who have been ostracized describe feeling less than human and tend to believe the person who has ostracized them also believes they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or partner feels someone close to them challenges their humanity , it can severely threaten many aspects of mental health , such as self-esteem , belonging , control , and meaningful existence .\nA lot of people seem to think that using the silent treatment to get their partner to give in to something is okay and well , it \u2019 s not .\nSilence is not the way to go about getting what you want and if you \u2019 re doing things this way you should be ashamed of yourself .\nNot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you \u2019 re really hurting your partner and making them question far too much .\nThis kind of thing is sickening and is easily one of the more frustrating control tactics I have seen used .\nIt \u2019 s toxic and very unhealthy overall .\nSure , it \u2019 s fine to take a moment to relax and discuss something later but giving your partner the silent treatment isn \u2019 t alright .\nVeryWellMind wrote as follows on how this kind of thing is toxic : When the person using the silent treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaborate with one another , the person on the receiving end often will go to great lengths to restore the verbal aspect of the relationship .\nThis allows the silent person to feel vindicated , powerful , and in control , while the person on the receiving end feels confused and maybe even afraid of losing the relationship .\nWhat \u2019 s more , the silent person has successfully flipped the situation .\nThe conversation is now about appeasing them and not about the issue at hand .\nThe real issue is often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and communication in the relationship while the issues remain unresolved .\nAnd when this pattern of behavior happens on a regular basis , this is both toxic and abusive .\nResearchers have found that the silent treatment is used by both men and women to terminate a partner \u2019 s behaviors or words rather than to elicit them.1 In abusive relationships , the silent treatment is used to manipulate the other person and to establish power over them .\nSilence is used as a weapon to cut off meaningful conversations , stop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other person .\nIn fact , research shows that ignoring or excluding someone activates the same area of the brain that is activated by physical pain .\nMeanwhile , in non-abusive relationships , the silent treatment is often referred to as demand-withdraw interactions .\nIn these situations , one partner makes demands while the other partner withdraws or becomes silent.1 Although these interactions may appear similar to the silent treatment , the motives are different .\nTo learn more about the silent treatment and why you shouldn \u2019 t be using it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look below .\nThis kind of thing is not okay and you shouldn \u2019 t think it

blades , teeth , and limb bones from at least four individuals , including an adult and two juveniles , that were out of place among known hominids .\nEvery time Berger and his team tried to make a

fans out there who really know The Silmarillion ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ this molar , which belonged to Paranthropus Robusts , it was still not a match .\nP. Robustus appeared sometime between 1 and 2 million years ago .\nIts large , tough teeth had thick enamel and a strong jaw , thought to be ideal for tearing through plants that were otherwise difficult to chew .\nWhat makes this even more complicated is that evolution can take unexpected turns .\nGhosts of the past can return during different evolutionary phases .\nPowerful teeth and jaws as found in P. Robustus are often thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but define \u201c primitive.\n\u201d Homo Naledi , one of the two species discovered by Berger and his team , lived around 250,000 years ago , but its skull was not much larger than a chimpanzee \u2019 s and looks deceptively more primitive than its age suggests .\n\u201c [ Homo Naledi \u2019 s ] humanlike aspects are contrasted in the postcrania with a more primitive or australopith-like trunk , shoulder , pelvis and proximal femur , \u201d Berger said in a study published in eLife after the discovery of this species .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown species goes further than archaeological stereotypes .\nBoth its front and back teeth were large , compared to only the back teeth of P.

.\nRecent studies have suggested that neutrinos exhibit time symmetry violations .\nSo in a new study , researchers from Griffith University , the National Measurement Institute ( NMI ) and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization ( ANSTO ) are attempting to measure these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their antimatter counterparts , anti-neutrinos , are produced in nuclear reactors , so that \u2019 s where the new experiment will be conducted .\nThe team has installed two extremely precise atomic clocks in the OPAL reactor in Sydney , and the idea is that if the clocks fall out of sync , it would be evidence of quantum time dilation , which itself would be evidence of local T violations .\nTime dilation is a well-studied phenomenon , predicted by the theory of relativity .\nIf you have an atomic clock on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orbiting Earth , the ground clock will tick ever-so-slightly faster than the one in the sky .\nThat \u2019 s thanks to differences in gravity , which bends spacetime .\nVaccaro says that there \u2019 s currently no reason to believe that time dilation should also occur in a nuclear reactor , so if any sign of it is found it could support her hypothesis

results could be fascinating .\nIt \u2019 s almost expected that there would be a null @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path of physics .\nBut if the experiment does find evidence of time dilation , it could be a huge breakthrough .\nThat \u2019 s a big \u201c if , \u201d but one worth at least checking .\nUsing a nuclear reactor for this is perfect in a sense because of the neutrinos as noted above .\nWho knows

is not likely to tell anyone about their abuse .\nOften , the abusive adult will convince the child that they won \u2019 t be believed or that they are somehow responsible for the abuse and will be punished for it .\nThe child may care about or feel protective of the person who sexually abused them and may feel they \u2019 d be betraying this person by telling about the sexual contact and the abuser may use this information to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent to protect a non-abusive parent from upsetting information .\nSometimes , a child may be confused if they experienced positive physical pleasure , arousal , or emotional intimacy from the abuse .\nThis confusion can make it difficult for the child to speak up .\nA child may feel that they permitted the abuse and should have been able to stop it .\nRemember that there are no situations where a child is responsible for any sexual interaction with a more powerful child or adult .\nPeople who abuse children may offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threats about what will happen if the child says \u2018 no \u2019 or tells someone .\nThey may scare the child with threats of being hurt physically , but more often the threat is about what will be lost if they tell e.g .\nthe family breaking up or someone going to prison .\nAs this child grows up , they may choose to remain silent because they feel guilty for not saying anything for so long and

victims have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even with the most violent and sadistic types of sexual abuse .\nThis confuses victims , causing them to believe that perhaps they gave consent or may have even instigated the sexual involvement .\nThe reasoning goes like this , \u201c If my body responded ( through a pleasurable sensation , an orgasm , an erection ) it must mean that I wanted it.\n\u201d It is very important to understand that experiencing physical pleasure does not signify consent .\nOur bodies are created to respond to physical touch , no matter who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims of abuse were so deprived of affection that they spontaneously accept and respond to any physical attention , no matter what its source .\nAnother reason why many question whether they were really abused is that they may not have a clear memory of what happened .\nThey may have only vague memories or no memories at all , just a strong suspicion based on their feelings and perhaps their symptoms .\nIt \u2019 s difficult to believe your feelings when you have no or very few actual memories .\nSome people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , fearing that \u201c I \u2019 m just imagining \u201d or \u201c I \u2019 m making

forth all the time , but this enormous whale went without being spotted for so long its identification is mind-blowing .\nThis species is known as the Rice whale now , and it is quite large .\nWhile this whale became stranded back in 2019 information on it has only now been processed properly and brought to light .\nThe Smithsonian Magazine just days ago wrote on this topic and put some much-needed answers forth .\nWe now know that the Rice whale can reach up to 42 feet in length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2019 was about 38 feet .\nThis species was until this incident previously unknown .\nA study covering this whale and its discovery according to The Smithsonian Magazine was published about a month ago within the journal Marine Mammal Science .\nThis breaking down just how endangered

Mexico off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted above goes as follows : Bryde \u2019 s\u2010like whales are a complex of medium\u2010sized baleen whales that occur in tropical waters of all three major ocean basins .\nCurrently , a single species of Bryde \u2019 s whale , Balaenoptera edeni Anderson , 1879 , is recognized , with two subspecies , Eden \u2019 s whale , B. edeni edeni and Bryde \u2019 s whale , B. edeni brydei ( Olsen , 1913 ) , although some authors have recognized these as separate species .\nRecently , a new , evolutionarily divergent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identified based on genetic data and was found to be restricted primarily to the northern Gulf of Mexico ( GOMx ) .\nHere , we provide the first morphological examination of a complete skull from these whales and identify diagnostic characters that distinguish it from the other medium\u2010sized baleen whale taxa .\nIn addition , we have increased the number of genetic samples of these Bryde \u2019 s\u2010like whales in the GOMx from 23 to 36 individuals , all of which matched the GOMx lineage .\nA review of Bryde \u2019 s\u2010like whale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supports an isolated distribution for this unique lineage , augmenting the genetic and morphological body of evidence supporting the existence of an undescribed species of Balaenoptera from the Gulf of Mexico .\nWhile this might not sound like much to some , it is an amazing discovery that most of us were not expecting .\nIt \u2019 s not every day that you stumble across a whale that \u2019 s stuck outside of water , let alone one that is of a species we \u2019 ve never seen before within reason .\nAfter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things were brought out in the open about this marvelous creature .\nThe Smithsonian Magazine wrote as follows going over this topic : Dale Rice , a marine mammal scientist with a storied 60-year career , is the new species \u2019 namesake .\nRice recognized that a small population of whales was living in the northeastern part of the Gulf of Mexico year-round in the 1990s .\nBut at the time , the assumption was that these were a sub-population of Bryde \u2019 s whales , reports Greg Allen for NPR .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ genetic analysis of tissue samples from the mysterious Gulf population .\nThat analysis suggested the population was genetically distinct from other Bryde \u2019 s whales , reports Michael Marshall of New Scientist .\n\u201c But we didn \u2019 t have a skull , \u201d Patricia Rosel , a geneticist at the NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center and lead author of the paper , tells New Scientist .\nA skull , Rosel says , is essential to establishing a new species of whale .\nWhen a fisher spotted a 38-foot carcass near Sandy Key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the necropsy suggested it was worth a closer look .\n\u201c Through some really enormous efforts of the stranding network to respond to that dead whale\u2026and save it and preserve it , we were finally able to look at the skull morphology and make comparisons to those other Bryde \u2019 s whales , \u201d Rosel tells NPR .\nTo clean the massive skeleton for study , NOAA scientists and members of the Marine Mammal Stranding Network buried it underground at Fort De Soto Park for several months , and finally unearthed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s National Museum of Natural History where Rosel and others were able to study the specimen in detail .\nThe skull

apparently , some things are slipping through that definitely shouldn \u2019 t be .\nA recent congressional report has been making headlines as some mind-blowing things are being brought to light as a

investigation that was released Thursday .\nIf you use baby food , you need to be aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the topic : \u201c Dangerous levels of toxic metals like arsenic , lead , cadmium and mercury exist in baby foods at levels that exceed what experts and governing bodies say are permissible , \u201d said Democratic Rep.

we should not have anything more than single digit parts per billion of any of these metals in any of our foods , \u201d he told CNN .\nArsenic , lead , cadmium and mercury are in the World Health

and regions , however , contain more toxic levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overuse of metal-containing pesticides and ongoing industrial pollution .\n\u201c There was a time where we used metals as the predominant pesticide for many years , assuming it was safe , \u201d said Dr. Leonardo Trasande , chief of environmental pediatrics at NYU Langone .\nAll of these heavy metals have been linked to cancer , chronic disease and neurotoxic effects , but it \u2019 s the devastating damage that can be done to a developing baby \u2019 s brain that makes baby food toxicity so critical .\nThe US Food and Drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for heavy metals in most infant food .\nThe agency did set a standard of 100 parts per billion inorganic arsenic for infant rice cereal , but even that level is considered much too high for baby \u2019 s safety , critics say , especially since the FDA has already set a much lower standard of 10 parts per billion of inorganic arsenic for bottled water .\nThese foods made by some of the largest commercial baby food manufacturers according to The Washington Post as noted in the report contain significant levels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lead , cadmium , and mercury , which can endanger infant neurological development.\n\u2019 This is not something to take lightly as you will likely agree .\nWhen it comes to our babies , we want to make sure they \u2019 re not eating anything that could in the long-run hurt them .\nThe Washington Post reported as follows breaking things down further : The report released Thursday from the House Oversight Committee \u2019 s subcommittee on economic and consumer policy found heavy metals in rice cereals , sweet potato puree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the most trusted names in baby food .\nGerber , Beech-Nut , HappyBABY (

much further than most realize and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get you where they want you quite quickly .\nThis kind of thing is all too common .\nI know , it \u2019 s a bit out there and when we find ourselves in the hands of narcissists we tend to ask ourselves how we never saw the signs , but the truth is , the signs were not as present as we may have thought they were .\nThere might have been a few red flags , but the narcissist was doing everything in his or her power to make sure we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in way too deep .\nThat is just how these kinds of people work .\nPsychology Today wrote on this topic and stated as follows : Both direct and indirect manipulations are used to keep an individual close and attached .\nThe exaggerated and dramatic tales are meant to maintain attention that may be slipping .\nIt is important to understand that these tactics are not due to the manipulator loving you and wanting you to stay ; rather , it is because your love , attention , and attachment are beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between a narcissist and her partner as a rope .\nThe rope used to be coated in something attractive and comforting and soothing ; it was coercive enough to entrap the individual into thinking the possession was love .\nAs the relationship lengthened , the rope got tighter and more in control of the manipulator .\nBut as the rope \u2019 s tension increased , the warm and deceitful covering began to wear off and the rope itself began to chafe and burn against the victim .\nManipulations are used as an effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and keep it from snapping , thus setting the victim free .\nNarcissists can not accept the fact that another person does not want to be with them or even goes as far as rejecting the narcissist .\nRemember that a key trait of narcissists is an overblown , undeserved ego and an inner belief that people are jealous of them .\nTo them , it is simply not possible that their partner doesn \u2019 t love them and can live happily without them .\nIf the narcissist loses the attention and affirmations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-controlled , they will go to extreme lengths to regain that control through manipulation .\nSome methods of manipulation are direct , brash , and used to incite empathy from the victim .\nThese individuals will not think twice about threatening suicide or even claiming to have a plan for their suicide .\nThe purpose of this is to awaken the caretaker trait in the abused partner and keep them close .\nThis basically highlights manipulation and its role with the narcissist .\nNarcissists are manipulating us from the get-go whether we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only gets worse as time continues to pass .\nThe more time we spend with them , the more warped things within our own minds can become

pick up on small things that you would never notice .\nBelow I am going to go over some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that only those who are genuinely happy do , do you do these things ?\n10 Things People Who Are Actually Happy Tend To Have In Common : 1 .\nThey offer encouragement and do not judge .\nHappy people are not the kinds of people who cut others down and break them apart .\nThey do not judge and are always willing to help the people in their lives grow .\nThat being said , they are not overbearing with it .\n2 .\nThey do not expect too much from themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have expectations for themselves but that those expectations should be realistic .\nThey treat themselves as kindly as they do others .\nThey know their own personal worth .\n3 .\nThey are as present in the moment as possible .\nHappy people are usually quite mindful overall .\nThey are always working to make the most of the time before them .\nThey know that tomorrow is not promised .\n4 .\nThey value their time and efforts .\nHappy people do not waste their efforts on people who do not want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most of what is before them .\nSure , they help others but they know their own limits and when their efforts are being wasted .\nThis is very important .\n5 .\nThey are patient with themselves .\nHappy people are as patient with themselves as they are with others .\nThey do not beat themselves down and instead work to grow through all they face .\nThey are capable of seeing the bigger picture in most everything .\nHappy people do not get upset when others accomplish things , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feat worth celebrating .\nThey want to see people progress and make changes .\nThey feel as happy for you as you are about what you \u2019 re experiencing .\n7 .\nThey do not obsess over things they can not change .\nIf a happy person can not change something , they don \u2019 t obsess over it .\nThey know that they can \u2019 t do anything about it , and so they learn from it and let it go .\nThis is a very hard lesson for us to face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to take on .\n8 .\nThey don \u2019 t try to fix people .\nHappy people know that other people are not going to let you fix them .\nThey will fix themselves when they are ready .\nThis in itself is not something you can force .\n9 .\nThey are kind to the people who are closest to them .\nHappy people do not treat the people in their close circle badly .\nThey are kind and caring above all else .\nThey support those who support them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we grow through our experiences , good and bad .\nHappy people are not always as happy as you might think they are .\nThey too go through ups and downs .\nThey know that the things this world brings our way happen for a reason and that as we face the challenges life puts before us , we grow .", "author": "Gerald Sinclair", "url": "https://awarenessact.com/10-common-traits-among-genuinely-happy-people/", "published": "Wed, 17 Feb 2021 01:38:07 +0000", "published_utc":

annoying , this accomplishment is well worth knowing about .\nYou see , researchers in Germany have managed to perform something that Physics World is referring to as a \u2018 Quantum Gate Operation.\n\u2019 The study on this in itself was published in Science under the title \u2018 A quantum-logic gate between distant quantum-network modules \u2019 and basically it goes over how researchers were able to connect two atomic qubits that were in separate labs .\nWhile that sounds impossible , it apparently is not .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ is something that in time could become somewhat normal overall .\nThe abstract of this study goes as follows : The big challenge in quantum computing is to realize scalable multi-qubit systems with cross-talk\u2013free addressability and efficient coupling of arbitrarily selected qubits .\nQuantum networks promise a solution by integrating smaller qubit modules to a larger computing cluster .\nSuch a distributed architecture , however , requires the capability to execute quantum-logic gates between distant qubits .\nHere we experimentally realize such a gate over a distance of 60 meters .\nWe employ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from two remote qubit modules , followed by a heralding photon detection , which triggers a final qubit rotation .\nWe use the gate for remote entanglement creation of all four Bell states .\nOur nonlocal quantum-logic gate could be extended both to multiple qubits and many modules for a tailor-made multi-qubit computing register .\nWhile implementing this gate was quite the task , these researchers managed just fine and were able to entangle things properly .\nThe quantum gate overall is something that I personally did not think I would be hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind big time .\nWith the confirmation of this working and more research that will be done in the years to come , who knows what else we may be able to accomplish even just through this ?\nPhysics World wrote as follows on the topic : The protocol produces a \u201c heralded \u201d quantum gate in which the detection of the photon signals a successful gate operation .\nIn future , this could prove crucial to producing a reliable quantum computer as such a confirmation that each successive gate has worked is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequence .\nOther platforms could theoretically produce quantum gates using the researchers \u2019 protocol , says Daiss , if the qubit could be coupled sufficiently strongly to a cavity or resonator .\nFor instance , this has already been achieved with trapped ions or superconducting qubits .\nIn future , says Daiss , a next step would be to connect together modules comprising more than one qubit and producing computers with more than one module : \u201c We could go in either direction , and both directions will benefit from the work we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d he concludes .\nRonald Hanson of Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands believes the paper marks an important step forward : \u201c They just have this one photon scattering off one side , going to the other side and then you measure it .\nConceptually it \u2019 s super simple , and they show that it works.\n\u201d he says .\n\u201c So it \u2019 s the fact that it \u2019 s heralded , and its efficiency \u2013 I think that \u2019 s the real novelty of the work.\n\u201d What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nDoes it

details on observing .\nOne caveat for northern observers .\nThe asteroid is placed relatively low in the southern sky .\nAs asteroid 2001 FO32 passes by Earth , observers using telescopes might try to spot it as it glides through the southern constellations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the southern U.S. , the asteroid will be low in the sky , above the southern horizon ( about 20 degrees or lower ) , just

it .\nIt works because it reduces sperm count , mobility , and so forth .\nWhile it does this when the test subject is on the medication when they come off of it according to this research it only takes a few weeks for things to go back to normal .\nThat in itself is where the concept that this form of male contraceptive could essentially work for men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about this ?\nWould

for a while now , we may now know more about it .\nThere are still many unanswered questions , but we \u2019 re getting somewhere , or at least that \u2019 s how it seems .\nThis interesting interstellar object was first discovered in 2017 and ever since we \u2019 ve been trying to learn more about it but that in itself hasn \u2019 t been easy .\nWhile this object is comet-like it is still quite odd in a lot of ways .\nThat being said , research as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could ever imagine .\nPhys.org wrote as follows on this : Two Arizona State University astrophysicists , Steven Desch and Alan Jackson of the School of Earth and Space Exploration , set out to explain the odd features of \u2018 Oumuamua and have determined that it is likely a piece of a Pluto-like planet from another solar system .\nTheir findings have been recently published in a pair of papers in the AGU Journal of Geophysical Research : Planets .\n\u201c In many ways \u2018 Oumuamua resembled a comet , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded its nature , and speculation ran rampant about what it was , \u201d said Desch , who is a professor in the School of Earth and Space Exploration .\nFrom observations of the object , Desch and Jackson determined several characteristics of the object that differed from what would be expected from a comet .\nIn terms of speed , the object entered the solar system at a velocity a bit lower than would be expected , indicating that it had not been traveling in interstellar space for more than a billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size , its pancake shape was also more flattened than any other known solar system object .\nThey also observed that while the object acquired a slight push away from the sun ( a \u201c rocket effect \u201d common in comets as sunlight vaporizes the ices they are made of ) , the push was stronger than could be accounted for .\nFinally , the object lacked a detectable escaping gas , which is usually depicted visibly by a comet \u2019 s tail .\nIn all , the object was very much like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had ever been observed in the solar system .\nDesch and Jackson then hypothesized that the object was made of different ices and they calculated how quickly these ices would sublimate ( passing from a solid to a gas ) as \u2018 Oumuamua passed by the sun .\nFrom there , they calculated the rocket effect , the object \u2019 s mass and shape , and the reflectivity of the ices .\n\u201c That was an exciting moment for us , \u201d Desch said .\n\u201c We realized that a chunk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people were assuming , which meant it could be smaller .\nThe same rocket effect would then give \u2018 Oumuamua a bigger push , bigger than comets usually experience.\n\u201d Basically through their research , these scientists were able to note that Oumuamua may somehow be a chunk of an exoplanet .\nThis meaning it \u2019 s not necessarily a comet or an asteroid like previously thought .\nWhile more information is needed , this could be a step in the right direction depending on how things play out in the future .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ?\nI , for one , can not wait to see what more we can uncover about Oumuamua .\nThis in itself could

thought we knew how stars were formed but things as of late have changed in that department .\nNew observations are shaping the future of how we look at star formation as a whole .\nOn March 18th of this year 2021 , NASA wrote on this topic and really brought a lot to the table .\nThey noted that while we currently know that stars form from the \u2018 collapse of huge hydrogen clouds that are squeezed under gravity to the point where nuclear fusion ignites \u2019 there is more to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while some of that hydrogen goes on to form the star , we previously didn \u2019 t know much about what happened to the rest of the hydrogen at play .\nNASA wrote as follows going over this topic : Researchers used data previously collected from NASA \u2019 s Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes and the European Space Agency \u2019 s Herschel Space Telescope to analyze 304 developing stars , called protostars , in the Orion Complex , the nearest major star-forming region to Earth .\n( Spitzer and Herschel are no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nascent stars to date , researchers are finding that gas-clearing by a star \u2019 s outflow may not be as important in determining its final mass as conventional theories suggest .\nThe researchers \u2019 goal was to determine whether stellar outflows halt the infall of gas onto a star and stop it from growing .\nInstead , they found that the cavities in the surrounding gas cloud sculpted by a forming star \u2019 s outflow did not grow regularly as they matured , as theories propose .\n\u201c In one stellar formation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small cavity , as the protostar rapidly becomes more evolved , its outflow creates an ever-larger cavity until the surrounding gas is eventually blown away , leaving an isolated star , \u201d explained lead researcher Nolan Habel of the University of Toledo in Ohio .\n\u201c Our observations indicate there is no progressive growth that we can find , so the cavities are not growing until they push out all of the mass in the cloud .\nSo , there must be some other process going on that gets rid of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the star.\n\u201d These results are already present on arXiv.org but will be posted in The Astrophysical Journal soon .\nOf course , more research will need to be done but this sets the mood for something amazing to be found in the future on the topic .\nThis changes the roles around quite a bit and as we dive into these cavities as a whole who knows what we will find .\nThe abstract of the findings posted on arXiv.org go as follows : We study protostellar envelope and outflow evolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images of 304 protostars in the Orion Molecular clouds .\nThese near-IR images resolve structures in the envelopes delineated by the scattered light of the central protostars with 80 AU resolution and they complement the 1.2-870 micron spectral energy distributions obtained with the Herschel Orion Protostar Survey program ( HOPS ) .\nBased on their 1.60 micron morphologies , we classify the protostars into five categories : non-detections , point sources without nebulosity , bipolar cavity sources , unipolar cavity sources , and irregulars .\nWe find point sources without associated nebulosity are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monte Carlo radiative transfer modeling that this morphology occurs when protostars are observed at low inclinations or have low envelope densities .\nWe also find that the morphology is correlated with the SED-determined evolutionary class with Class 0 protostars more likely to be non-detections , Class I protostars to show cavities , and flat-spectrum protostars to be point sources .\nUsing an edge detection algorithm to trace the projected edges of the cavities , we fit power-laws to the resulting cavity shapes , thereby measuring the cavity half-opening angles and power-law exponents .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of outflow cavities as protostars evolve through the Class I protostar phase , in contradiction with previous studies of smaller samples .\nWe conclude that the decline of mass infall with time can not be explained by the progressive clearing of envelopes by growing outflow cavities .\nFurthermore , the low star formation efficiency inferred for molecular cores can not be explained by envelope clearing alone .\nWhat do you think about all of this ?\nI think it is truly mind-blowing in every sense of the word

at the same time by existing in a state of superstition , meaning each new qubit added to the computer increases its power exponentially rather than linearly .\nQuantum teleportation , therefore , is a transfer of quantum states from one location to the other .\nThis transfer was done by using quantum entanglement , where two particles are linked in such a way that information shared with one is

have what we call \u2018 near-death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversial in how things play out .\nAll of this having been said , the answers to life after death in itself could be something hidden within quantum mechanics .\nAccording to The Express , research that was going around back in 2018 really dove into this topic and suggested that at least on a quantum level , there may be more once our physical bodies have been lost .\nThis basically going over how the soul itself may on some level live on .\nI know , this might be confusing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are some researchers who believe that \u2018 quantum mechanics allows consciousness to live on following the body \u2019 s eventual demise.\n\u2019 Consciousness is something even now we do not know much about and are constantly working to better understand and so , there are tons of questions that need answers in all of this .\nIf you \u2019 ve ever heard of Sir Roger Penrose , you know that he believes that there is more to all of this than meets the eyes .\nThe Express wrote as follows going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still unsure about what exactly consciousness is , the University of Arizona \u2019 s Stuart Hameroff and British physicist Sir Roger Penrose believes that it is merely information stored at a quantum level .\nThe duo say this process is called \u201c Orchestrated Objective Reduction \u201d ( Orch-OR ) and say it is evidence that protein-based microtubules \u2013 a structural component of human cells \u2013 carry quantum information \u2013 information stored at a sub-atomic level .\nDr Hameroff explains : \u201c Let \u2019 s say the heart stops beating , the blood stops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state .\n\u201c The quantum information within the micro-tubules is not destroyed , it can \u2019 t be destroyed , and it just distributes and dissipates to the universe at large .\n\u201c If the patient is resuscitated , revived , this quantum information can go back into the micro-tubules and the patient says , \u2018 I had a near-death experience.\n\u2019 \u201c If they \u2019 re not revived , and the patient dies , it \u2019 s possible that this quantum information can exist outside the body , perhaps indefinitely , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max Planck Institute for physics in Munich agree and state that the physical universe that we live in is only our perception and once our physical bodies die , there is an infinite beyond .\nWhile this isn \u2019 t something set in stone , it is interesting to learn about .\nThere is a lot more to reality than most of us want to accept and as we continue to dive into

Why You Shouldn\u2019t Worry About Not Having Children", "content": "While you might be getting hounded by friends and family about when you \u2019 re going to have a mini-me , you don \u2019 t have to have one or any if it \u2019 s not something you \u2019 re interested in .\nIf you want children and can care for them properly , go for it but don \u2019 t spend time worrying about being childless if you aren \u2019 t even someone who wants to have them in the first place or if you \u2019 re unsure of what you want as a whole .\nThere is plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you choose to do-so later own the line and tons of options to make sure your sperm or eggs are saved to where you can if you decide to .\nBeing childless is more and more common these days and there is nothing wrong with it .\nThere are many benefits to having children , but there are also plenty of benefits to not having them as well .\nBelow I am going to go over some of the reasons why you shouldn \u2019 t be spending all your time worrying about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that you \u2019 re childless as a whole .\nNot having kids gives you more time for yourself and so much more .\nYes , being a parent is a beautiful thing , but it \u2019 s not for everyone and that \u2019 s not something to feel bad about .\n8 Reason Why You Shouldn \u2019 t Be Worried About Being \u2018 Childless \u2019 : 1 .\nBeing a parent adds more stress to life .\nWhile you \u2019 re probably already facing a lot of stress being a parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is worth it for those who want kids , it can be a lot to take in and sometimes is too much for some to handle .\nBeing responsible for a growing human isn \u2019 t as easy as it might sound .\n2 .\nYou \u2019 ll probably have more money if you remain childless .\nPeople who do not have kids tend to have more money to spend on other things .\nChildren are expensive and they have lots of needs .\nYou might not realize it offhand but as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more expensive .\n3 .\nHaving children can limit your goals on some levels .\nWhile having a kid doesn \u2019 t mean you can not follow your dreams it can put them off or things of that sort .\nBeing a parent means your goals have to be put on hold sometimes and for many that \u2019 s not something they want to deal with .\nAs a childless person , I have a lot I \u2019 m working on , and having kids just isn \u2019 t something I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone time is seemingly non-existent .\nWhen you have kids getting time to yourself isn \u2019 t easy anymore .\nYou can \u2019 t just pickup and do something at the drop of a hat .\nYou have to find a sitter and all of that .\n5 .\nBeing childless allows you to get more sleep .\nPeople with kids typically get up throughout the night to take care of them .\nThey have a lot to deal with and overall don \u2019 t get as much sleep as childless people or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you \u2019 re already not getting much rest adding a kid to that mixture might not be the best idea .\n6 .\nBeing childless helps keep some intimacy issues at bay , within reason .\nPeople who have children tend to go through intimacy issues with their partner at some point .\nWhile intimacy issues are common whether you have kids or not , it seems not having kids within reason can help keep them at bay in some situations .\nYou have more time to spend with your partner and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you \u2019 re childless , or at least it seems that way .\n7 .\nWhen you \u2019 re childless you can spend more time on self-care .\nHaving a kid doesn \u2019 t mean you have to give up self-care , but it does mean you can \u2019 t focus on it as properly as you should .\nYou have to plan times to do things out and make sure your kid has what he/she needs and is taken care of .\nYou \u2019 re always worrying about someone else and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re childless traveling is much easier to manage .\nTraveling with a tiny child or even a toddler can be quite the task .\nWhen you \u2019 re childless getting around is a lot easier .\nYou only have to keep up with and pack your things and if you want to change course last second , you can .", "author":

"While this happened a while back for some reason it has not garnered as much attention as it should have .\nSure , it might not sound like much but this whole concept really should blow those who learn about it away .\nIn November of 2020 , a study was published that you could call groundbreaking .\nThis study was one that went over how a group of scientists were somehow able to turn IBM \u2019 s largest quantum computer into literal quantum material .\nIn order to do this programming was needed on an extreme level and well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exciton condensate was revealed .\nThis is something we have only recently even learned existed according to The University of Chicago and well , from here who knows what we will be capable of .\nThe abstract of this study was published under the title \u2018 Preparation of an exciton condensate of photons on a 53-qubit quantum computer \u2019 and goes as follows : Quantum computation promises an exponential speedup of certain classes of classical calculations through the preparation and manipulation of entangled quantum states .\nSo far , most molecular simulations on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited to small numbers of particles .\nHere we prepare a highly entangled state on a 53-qubit IBM quantum computer , representing 53 particles , which reveals the formation of an exciton condensate of photon particles and holes .\nWhile the experimental realization of ground state exciton condensates remained elusive for more than 50 years , such condensates were recently achieved for electron-hole pairs in graphene bilayers and metal chalcogenides .\nOur creation of ground state photon condensates has the potential to further the exploration of exciton condensates , and this novel preparation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room-temperature energy transport .\nThrough these findings , it was noted that energy could be conducted with \u2018 almost zero loss.\n\u2019 This being an amazing find and quite the revelation .\nAs we continue to move forth more quantum materials will essentially come out to play as research is done and eventually we may end up with a lot to work with .\nExploring this material is something that most will never get the chance to do .\nThe University Of Chicago wrote as follows going more in-depth about these findings : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a century ago , until recently , no one had been able to actually make one work in the lab without having to use extremely strong magnetic fields .\nBut they intrigue scientists because they can transport energy without any loss at all\u2014something which no other material we know of can do .\nIf physicists understood them better , it \u2019 s possible they could eventually form the basis of incredibly energy-efficient materials .\nTo make an exciton condensate , scientists take a material made up of a lattice of particles , cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and coax it to form particle pairs called excitons .\nThey then make the pairs become entangled\u2014a quantum phenomenon where the fates of particles are tied together .\nBut this is all so tricky that scientists have only been able to create exciton condensates a handful of times .\n\u201c An exciton condensate is one of the most quantum-mechanical states you can possibly prepare , \u201d Mazziotti said .\nThat means it \u2019 s very , very far from the classical everyday properties of physics that scientists are used to dealing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes its quantum computers available for people around the world to test their algorithms ; the company agreed to \u201c loan \u201d its largest

quantum computer works by entangling its bits , so once the computer was active , the entire thing became an exciton condensate .\n\u201c It was a really cool result , in part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise of current quantum computers , the condensate does not appear as a single large condensate , but a collection of smaller condensates , \u201d Sager said .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think any of us would

Than Predicted", "content": "While we know on some level that sunlight has an effect on the coronavirus we \u2019 re currently facing , there may be more to it than previously thought .\nA study published not too long ago seems to suggest that sunlight might be able to actually inactivate covid around eight times faster than previously thought .\nThis according to UC Santa Barbara \u2019 s mechanical engineer Paolo Luzzatto-Regis seems to work because the UVB hits the RNA of the virus and damages it .\nThat being said , it is still more or less a theory .\nThis overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on than we realize .\nThere is more to this that we still right now are not aware of but in time we may better understand it .\nI know , this might not sound like much , but it brings a lot to the table .\nPart of this posting goes as follows and was published under the title \u2018 UBV Radiation Alone May Not Explain Sunlight Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 \u2019 : TO THE EDITOR\u2014Recently , Ratnesar-Shumate et al [ 1 ] reported rapid sunlight inactivation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in complete growth medium ( gMEM ) .\nIndependently and essentially simultaneously , Sagripanti and Lytle [ 2 ] introduced a theory for sunlight inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 , building on their earlier work with similar viruses [ 3 ] .\nTo the best of our knowledge , these data and theory had not been compared .\nWhen establishing this comparison , the experimentally reported sunlight inactivation in Ratnesar-Shumate et al [ 1 ] is several times faster than predicted by theory , suggesting that additional experiments and hypotheses may be needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inactivation .\nBriefly , the theory of Sagripanti and Lytle [ 2 , 3 ] considers direct photochemical damage to viral RNA , which is maximal for UVC ( wavelengths between 200 and 280 nm ) .\nThe effectiveness of UVC is expressed as the exposure that produces one e-fold reduction in infectious virion concentration ( ie , to 37 % of the initial value ) at a wavelength of 254 nm , which is written as D37 [ 3 ] .\nBecause larger D37 implies slower inactivation , D37 is effectively an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for Coronaviridae , Lytle and Sagripanti estimated D37 between 2.5 and 3.9 J/m2 , and D37 = 3.0 J/m2 for SARS-CoV-2 [ 2 ] ; this value is used in the calculations presented here .\nAlthough no UVC reaches the Earth \u2019 s surface , longer UV wavelengths can still affect viral RNA , albeit with decreased sensitivity .\nTo account for this , Lytle and Sagripanti [ 3 ] introduced an action spectrum , expressed as the ratio between sensitivity at a given wavelength \u03bb and the UVC sensitivity at 254 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ r ( \u03bb ) , and expressing the spectral irradiance at a given wavelength as Ee , \u03bb ( \u03bb ) , one can evaluate an equivalent UVC irradiance ( in W/m2 ) as Moving forward I \u2019 m sure more people will be looking into this .\nIt was also noted that UV-A could end up being more capable than other options .\nAs time keeps moving forth , we can only hope to better understand things as a whole .\nUC Santa Barbara wrote as follows on this topic : \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having UV-B hit the RNA of the virus , damaging it , \u201d said UC Santa Barbara mechanical engineering professor and lead author Paolo Luzzatto-Fegiz ( link is external ) .\nJudging from the discrepancies between the experimental results and the predictions of the theoretical model , however , the research team felt that RNA inactivation by UV-B \u201c might not be the whole story.\n\u201d According to the letter , the experiments demonstrated virus inactivation times of about 10-20 minutes \u2014 much faster than predicted by the theory .\n\u201c The theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of magnitude slower , \u201d Luzzatto-Fegiz said .\nIn the experiments , viruses in simulated saliva and exposed to UV-B lamps were inactivated more than eight times faster than would have been predicted by the theory , while those cultured in a complete growth medium before exposure to UV-B were inactivated more than three times faster than expected .\nTo make the math of the theory fit the data , according to the letter , SARS-CoV-2 would have to exceed the highest UV-B sensitivity of any currently known virus .\nOr , Luzzato-Fegiz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another mechanism at play aside from RNA inactivation by UV-B rays .\nFor instance , UV-A , another , less energetic component of sunlight might be playing a more active role than previously thought .\n\u201c People think of UV-A as not having much of an effect , but it might be interacting with some of the molecules in the medium , \u201d he said .\nThose reactive intermediate molecules in turn could be interacting with the virus , hastening inactivation .\nIt \u2019 s a concept familiar to those who work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhat do you think about all of this ?\nMoving forward what direction should we be stepping into ?\nI guess only time will tell .", "author": "Gerald Sinclair", "url": "https://awarenessact.com/sunlight-inactivates-coronavirus-8-times-faster-than-predicted/", "published": "Thu, 08

Total Lunar Eclipse Is Coming, And It\u2019s A Special One", "content": "The first lunar eclipse of 2021 is going to happen during the early hours of May 26 .\nBut this is going to be an especially super lunar event , as it will be a supermoon , a lunar eclipse and a red blood moon all at once .\nSo what does this all mean ?\nA supermoon occurs when a full or new moon coincides with the Moon \u2019 s closest approach to the Earth .\nThe Moon \u2019 s orbit around Earth is not perfectly circular .\nThis means the Moon \u2019 s distance from Earth varies as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closest point in the orbit , called the perigee , is roughly 45,000 kilometers ( 28,000 miles ) closer to Earth than the farthest point of the orbit .\nA full moon that happens near the perigee is called a supermoon .\nThe Moon appears 12 percent bigger when it \u2019 s closest to Earth compared to when it \u2019 s furthest .\nSo why is it super ?\nThe relatively close proximity of the Moon makes it seem a little bit bigger and brighter than usual , though the difference between a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to notice unless you \u2019 re looking at two pictures side by side .\nA lunar eclipse happens when the Earth \u2019 s shadow covers all or part of the Moon .\nThis can only happen during a full moon , so first , it helps to understand what makes a full moon .\nLike the Earth , half of the Moon is illuminated by the sun at any one time .\nA full moon happens when the Moon and the Sun are on opposite sides of the Earth .\nThis allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which looks like a round disc in the night sky .\nIf the Moon had a totally flat orbit , every full moon would be a lunar eclipse .\nBut the Moon \u2019 s orbit is tilted by about 5 degrees relative to Earth \u2019 s orbit .\nSo , most of the time a full moon ends up a little above or below the shadow cast by the Earth .\nBut twice in each lunar orbit , the Moon is on the same horizontal plane as both the Earth and Sun .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Sun , the Earth and the Moon will form a straight line and the Moon will pass through the Earth \u2019 s shadow .\nThis results in a total lunar eclipse .\nTo see a lunar eclipse , you need to be on the night side of the Earth while the Moon passes through the shadow .\nThe best place to see the eclipse on May 26 , 2021 , will be the middle of the Pacific Ocean , Australia , the East Coast of Asia and the West Coast of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the eastern half of the US , but only the very earliest stages before the Moon sets .\nWhy does the moon look red ?\nWhen the Moon is completely covered by Earth \u2019 s shadow it will darken , but doesn \u2019 t go completely black .\nInstead , it takes on a red color , which is why total lunar eclipses are sometimes called red or blood moons .\nSunlight contains all colors of visible light .\nThe particles of gas that make up Earth \u2019 s atmosphere are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while redder wavelengths pass through .\nThis is called Rayleigh scattering , and it \u2019 s why the sky is blue and sunrises and sunsets are often red .\nIn the case of a lunar eclipse , red light can pass through the Earth \u2019 s atmosphere and is refracted \u2013 or bent \u2013 toward the Moon , while blue light is filtered out .\nThis leaves the moon with a pale reddish hue during an eclipse .\nHopefully you will be able to go see this super lunar eclipse .\nWhen you @ @ @

we will talk about the roles various family members play and the kinds of families that become dysfunctional as well as child roles in dysfunctional families .\nDysfunctional families are usually of two types : \u2022 One or more of the parents are active alcoholics or addicted to drugs .\n\u2022 One or more of the parents have a Cluster B disorder , usually Narcissistic Personality Disorder but sometimes Borderline Personality Disorder , Antisocial Personality Disorder , or Histrionic Personality Disorder ( or a combination of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drug addicts , dysfunctional family dynamics are most prevalent when one or both of the partners suffer from a Cluster B disorder , especially Narcissistic Personality Disorder or Malignant Narcissism .\nAfter NPD , BPD is the most common disorder seen in the head of a dysfunctional family , though because it \u2019 s more common in women and Borderlines have more empathy than narcissists , BPD is most often seen in the codependent , passive partner .\nASPD ( psychopathy or sociopathy ) rarely appears by itself in dysfunctional families , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be raising children at all ( either because they \u2019 re incarcerated , their children have already been removed from the home , or they simply have no interest in raising children , ) but a parent could have Malignant Narcissism , which is a combination of NPD and ASPD .\nAlso , people with pure ASPD , though more likely to be criminals or involved in illegal activities , tend to be less emotionally abusive than people with NPD or even BPD .\nThey are merely selfish and lack empathy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they want , but they don \u2019 t care about getting emotional supply from others so they don \u2019 t engage in mind games like gaslighting , triangulating , projecting , and scapegoating ( unless there is a material reward involved or they are trying to avoid culpability ) .\nHowever , some people with ASPD are sadistic and enjoy tormenting family members for fun .\nOf all the Cluster B disorders , HPD is probably the least toxic ( Histrionics are shallow , attention-seeking , and dramatic , but not usually that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comorbid with another Cluster B disorder , such as NPD .\nIn some cases , a non-Cluster B mental illness ( such as Bipolar disorder ) that causes abusive acting-out behavior may be the culprit , but it \u2019 s less common because most other mental disorders are less easily hidden from others and the person appears \u201c crazier.\n\u201d Non-Cluster B disorders are also more easily treated with drugs or therapy , and except for psychotic disorders such as Schizophrenia , the afflicted person knows they have a problem and are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dysfunctional families can also be both mentally ill and addicted to drugs or alcohol .\nThe two often go together .\nIn fact , alcoholism and drug addiction are extremely common in people with Cluster B disorders .\nAlcohol and drugs are their attempt to fill the emptiness they feel inside themselves .\nEven if an alcoholic or drug addict doesn \u2019 t have an underlying Cluster B disorder , the behavior of an active addict/alcoholic is very similar to someone who has NPD .\nThe only difference in the behavior of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that for the narcissist , the \u201c fix \u201d is emotional ; for the alcoholic , it \u2019 s chemical .\nA non-Cluster B active addict or alcoholic can be every bit as emotionally abusive , self-centered , and manipulative as someone with NPD .\nOnly getting their next fix is important .\n( As an aside , it \u2019 s interesting to me that the 12 steps of AA and other 12-step programs almost all address the problem of narcissism by encouraging humility , responsibility , and amend-making .\nA person on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basically a sober person acting out in narcissistic ways , which may be their nature ) .\nSometimes only one partner has a mental disorder or addiction , but the non-afflicted parent is always going to be codependent to them .\nThe codependent parent , whether they have a disorder or not , almost always suffers from PTSD or Complex PTSD .\nIf both parents have a Cluster B disorder ( which I think is usually the case ) , the one who has NPD or Malignant Narcissism is almost always going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other family members .\nIf a Borderline is paired up with a Narcissist , the Borderline is almost always going to be codependent to the Narcissist , colluding in the abuse but also being abused themselves .\nSimilarly , if a Covert Narcissist is paired up with an Overt Narcissist , the Covert one is going to be codependent to them and possibly abused .\nSuch a scenario can lead to the Borderline or Covert Narcissist developing Stockholm Syndrome ( identifying with and colluding with their abuser ) .\nNon-Cluster B codependents can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s a complication of C-PTSD .\nThe codependent parent often ( but not always ) has a high degree of empathy , which is what drew them to the narcissist in the first place , in a misguided belief that they could \u201c fix \u201d them or they were led to believe that the narcissist could \u201c rescue \u201d them .\nThe Roles of the Children .\nIn the ACON community , there \u2019 s a lot of talk about Scapegoats and Golden Children , but there are other roles children can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed .\nIn a two-child family , most likely there will be a scapegoat and a golden child , but in larger families , there can also be a Lost Child , a Clown , and a Rescuer ( codependent ) .\nIt \u2019 s unhealthy for a child to be in any of these roles , but the Scapegoat and Golden Child roles in dysfunctional families are probably the most dangerous to a child \u2019 s mental and emotional health , for different reasons .\nEven in a two-child family , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the Wikipedia article , families in which the children \u2019 s roles change and shift are called Balkanized families\u2013this alludes to the constantly shifting loyalties and borders of the Balkan countries in Eastern Europe ) .\nBoth this and the Golden Child role are the soul-killing roles , but for different reasons .\nThe Scapegoat is the child who is targeted by the narcissistic ( or alcoholic ) parent .\nThe parent often is able to get the rest of the family to serve as flying monkeys and gang up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t want to \u201c own \u201d onto them .\nLike the sacrificial goats described in the Bible who were banished to the wilderness and tormented by villagers , the Scapegoated child carries all the shame the rest of the family doesn \u2019 t want to confront or deal with .\nAll the unwanted emotions and bad qualities are unloaded and projected onto them , so the abusers don \u2019 t have to confront or deal with these problems in themselves .\nUsually , it \u2019 s the most sensitive child of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that child tends to be the Truth Teller , the only family member who can see the dysfunction and may even react against it .\nThe most sensitive child , being the child who shows the most emotion , is also a threat to the narcissists in the family because emotional expression is such a frightening thing to them .\nIn many , if not most dysfunctional families , the expression of emotion is not allowed .\nSo the most emotional or sensitive child becomes the scapegoat , especially if they rebel against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scapegoat may be assigned the role of Bad Child , the Loser , the Stupid One , the Ugly One , the Crazy One , the Weak One , or any combination of these .\nNo matter what they do , they can not please the parents ( or the siblings who have been turned against them ) .\nScapegoat Children usually develop severe C-PTSD or possibly another mental disorder , and having been trained to be victims and never given the emotional , financial or other tools to succeed in life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being \u201c losers , \u201d so then their families can say to others , \u201c See ?\nThis child really is worthless.\n\u201d Scapegoated children also tend to attract other abusers throughout their lives and are at risk of being targeted for bullying even as adults and for entering into abusive relationships .\nIf the adult child doesn \u2019 t go No Contact , the abuse continues , usually through some form of isolation , silent treatment , or exclusion .\nScapegoated adults are talked badly about by the family and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given no emotional or financial support , even though other members of the family are given these things .\nIt \u2019 s not unusual for a scapegoated adult child to be living in poverty , even if their families are wealthy\u2013not only because they were denied financial support when they needed it , but also because their self-esteem took such a terrible beating that they have no confidence at all and never take any risks that could improve their lives .\nSevere C-PTSD can also cause a person to have an inability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nA Scapegoat isn \u2019 t always a child .\nIt can also be a parent , in which the children are turned against that parent by the abusive one .\nThe Golden Child , often ( but not always ) the eldest child , is the parent \u2019 s trophy , pride , and joy .\nThe parents may seem to love that child , but being incapable of real love , their \u201c love \u201d is conditional and is based on their fantasy of what they want that child to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is .\nThe child is assigned to be a Mini-Me of the narcissistic parent .\nThe Golden Child , basking in constant approval , showered with toys and gifts , never held accountable for any wrongdoing ( which may be projected onto the Scapegoat ) , and often recruited as a co-abuser in the abuse of the Scapegoat , grows up entitled , grandiose , and spoiled .\nBecause their Real Self has never been appropriately mirrored and their less than perfect traits are ignored or projected onto someone else , and because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Perfect One , a Golden Child in a family is the most likely to develop NPD and become a clone of the abusive parent .\nIn this way their souls are destroyed even more than the Scapegoat \u2019 s .\nTo continue to be the parent \u2019 s favorite , they had to play a role which became internalized .\nThis becomes their False Self .\nAfter a while , they are no longer able to access their Real Self at all .\nGolden Children who have become narcissistic continue their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior into adulthood and are likely to head dysfunctional families themselves , continuing the cycle .\nA non-Golden Child , even a Scapegoat , can become a narcissist too ( usually the covert form of NPD ) , for self-protection , but Golden Children tend to develop the grandiose , malignant form of narcissism and as such , are the least likely to ever seek help for their disorder or admit they have become abusers themselves .\nIn larger families ( three or more children ) , one child is likely to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t exist .\nThis isn \u2019 t a form of silent treatment ; it \u2019 s as if the parents don \u2019 t notice the child is there at all .\nThe Lost Child isn \u2019 t victimized like the Scapegoat , but they aren \u2019 t spoiled either .\nThey may or may not be recruited to assist in the abuse of the Scapegoat , but they won \u2019 t necessarily be punished if they don \u2019 t cooperate ; they will simply be ignored .\nThe Lost Child roles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shy , and not make any waves .\nThey are probably aware of the family dysfunction and may sympathize with the scapegoat ( but don \u2019 t let anyone know this ) .\nAs they grow older , they may crave attention or develop addictions , or they may remain shy and retiring throughout their lives .\nThey tend to avoid confrontation and drama and may become extremely introverted .\nThe Clown/Mascot attempts to divert attention away from the family dysfunction ( and also get attention for themselves ) by making light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and they even use their own families as sources for humor .\nClowns can be disruptive in class as children , to get attention , but because of their ability to see the humor in things , they tend to be outgoing and develop a large circle of friends during adolescence and adulthood ( even if they are never taken very seriously ) .\nFamily Mascots are almost never scapegoated because they entertain everyone and take the focus off the family problems .\nDavid Sedaris , a writer , and humorist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at play .\nSeveral writers in the ACON community ( and even outside that community ) were outraged by Sedaris \u2019 callous essay ( \u201c Now We Are Five , \u201d which appeared in the New Yorker after his younger sister , Tiffany , committed suicide ) .\nTiffany was clearly the family scapegoat and had evidently gone No Contact with the rest of the family .\nAt the time of her death , she was living in poverty and only had , as her father put it , \u201c two lousy boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t know all the details , but it seems as if she was offered no support , either emotionally or financially , in spite of the family \u2019 s wealth and Sedaris \u2019 success as a writer .\nShe was probably mentally ill , but her mental illness may have been due to being the family reject .\nIn a candid interview Sedaris gave for Vice , he describes Tiffany and her relationship with the rest of the family .\nHis words are very telling .\nEven as a child I looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be like , not to feel the warmth of my mother \u2019 s love .\nTiffany didn \u2019 t .\nThere was always a nervous quality about her , a tentativeness , a desperate urge to be in your good graces .\nWhile the rest of us had eyes in the front of our heads , she had eyes on the sides , like a rabbit or a deer , like prey , always on the lookout for danger .\nEven when there wasn \u2019 t any danger .\nYou \u2019 d see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger ?\nI \u2019 ll give you some danger\u2026 It \u2019 s been suggested that David Sedaris is himself a narcissist ( possibly the golden child ) and that could certainly be true , but I also suspect he served a secondary role as the family Clown/Mascot .\nHis callousness toward Tiffany in his famous essay ( and grandiosity about how great the rest of the Sedaris family was\u2013it \u2019 s very common for narcissists who were golden children to hold their dysfunctional families up as paragons of perfection ) seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to hide his anger and pain behind a wall of humor .\nHere \u2019 s a link to his essay ( it \u2019 s heartbreaking and maybe triggering ) : Now We Are Five The accompanying photo is interesting .\nTiffany , the second to the youngest child in a family of six children , sits in the bottom right-hand corner .\nHer hair is cut short and unkempt , and she looks very unhappy .\nDavid , wearing the glasses , stands above her .\nActually , none of the kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bunch .\nSomething \u2019 s definitely not right about this family .\nIt \u2019 s common to see family portraits where no one is smiling in the 18th or 19th centuries , but not in the late 1960s , when this photo was taken .\nHere \u2019 s another photo , from the Vice interview , where only Tiffany ( again in the bottom right-hand spot ) looks desperately unhappy and disconnected from her siblings .\nI used to enjoy Sedaris \u2019 writings and looked forward to his books and essays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just can \u2019 t read him anymore .\n( Augusten Burroughs is a better alternative and doesn \u2019 t seem to be a narcissist ) .\nIn spite of their raucous and jovial manner , Clowns are likely to be depressed because they have never learned to confront or deal with their true feelings .\nThey hide behind a wall of laughter .\nTheir sense of humor is really just a cover for their pain .\nMany Clowns become addicted to drugs or alcohol , and a few become suicidal .\nMany of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their families .\nI don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s a coincidence that so many of them had drug issues or killed themselves .\nThe codependent child roles in dysfunctional families is to attempts to \u201c fix \u201d the family dysfunction by being obedient , always good , non-confrontational , overly generous , and self-sacrificing .\nThe Rescuer may be highly empathic .\nThe Rescuer tries to serve all the needs of the narcissistic/addicted parent , which of course is not possible .\nThey will never argue with or criticize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get everyone to get along , which also is not possible .\nThey may be the only family member who doesn \u2019 t abuse the Scapegoat , but they might if they feel like it \u2019 s required .\nHowever , even if they do collude in the Scapegoat \u2019 s abuse , they will be less abusive than the other family members , tending to take a back seat or even sympathize with the Scapegoat in private .\nIn trying to please everyone , they please no one and grow up feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a no-win situation .\nWhen Rescuers become adults , they tend to unconsciously look for other abusers to \u201c rescue , \u201d having failed to do so in their families of origin .\nLike Scapegoats , Rescuers are likely to become abused themselves as adults , but it \u2019 s hard for them to leave an abuser because of their high level of empathy which keeps them tied to the abuser in their attempt to want to \u201c help \u201d them .\nThey also tend to fall for an abuser \u2019 s promises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d back into a codependent relationship .\nIn Balkanized families , child roles in dysfunctional families can shift .\nThe most common situation is a Golden Child becoming a Scapegoat , often upon reaching adulthood , if they fail to fulfill the unrealistic expectations put on them .\n( \u201c You were such a disappointment to me !\n\u201d ) If a Scapegoat goes No Contact or leaves the family for some other reason , another child , possibly the Lost Child , becomes the new Scapegoat .\nSomeone has to carry all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only has two children , the Golden Child may find themselves suddenly scapegoated or serving both roles .\nChildren who serve as both Scapegoats and Golden Children ( very common in only children ) often develop Borderline Personality Disorder as well as severe C-PTSD and possibly other mental disorders like Dissociative Identity Disorder ( almost always the result of severe emotional abuse ) .\nServing as both a Scapegoat and Golden Child is the ultimate mindf*ck because there isn \u2019 t even any consistency .\nThe child never knows if they will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next .\nTheir only advantage ( if they are an only child ) is that they don \u2019 t have siblings who have been turned into flying monkeys who collude in the abuse .\nIf the family ever develops a need for a new Scapegoat ( if the Scapegoat goes No Contact , dies , or disappears ) , the Lost Child is usually picked as a replacement , due to their non-confrontational , malleable temperament and lack of any real pre-existing role in the family .\nDysfunctional families are difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects on a child \u2019 s psyche and sometimes well into their adulthood .\nIf you agree about these child roles in dysfunctional families , let us know in

throwing a tantrum .\nIt \u2019 s blowing a tremendous wind into intergalactic space , and we \u2019 re seeing the storm light from 13.1 billion years ago , when the Universe was less than 10 percent of its current age .\nIt \u2019 s the most distant such tempest we \u2019 ve ever identified , and its discovery is a clue that could help astronomers unravel the history of galaxy formation .\n\u201c The question is when did galactic winds come into existence in the Universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan ( NAOJ ) .\n\u201c This is an important question because it is related to an important problem in astronomy : how did galaxies and supermassive black holes coevolve ?\n\u201d Supermassive black holes can not be separated from galaxies .\nThese huge objects , millions to billions of times the mass of the Sun , make up the powerful heart of the galactic system \u2013 the gravitational nucleus around which everything else in the galaxy revolves .\nThey also play a huge role in how their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do so is a mechanism called feedback .\nPowerful winds from the supermassive black hole gust through space , blowing away material that would produce stars in some areas , or forcing it to collapse into new stars in others .\nUltimately , the black hole \u2019 s presence sets constraints on the stellar mass of the galaxy .\nInterestingly , the mass of a supermassive black hole is generally roughly proportional to the central bulge of the galaxy around it .\nAstronomers are not sure why it happens , since a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supermassive black hole , by about 10 orders of magnitude ; but the proportionality suggests that supermassive black holes and their galaxies evolve together , rather than forming separately and coming together later .\nTo investigate how early feedback can be observed in the Universe , Izumi and his colleagues used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array ( ALMA ) radio telescope in Chile to look for motion in the gas flows around galaxies with supermassive black holes in the early Universe .\nThey found a galaxy called J1243+0100 , just a few hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Analysis of the radio emission from dust in the galaxy suggested powerful outflows of 500 kilometers ( 310 miles ) per second , at an outflow rate of 447 times the mass of the Sun per year \u2013 definitely powerful enough to quench the birth of any stars .\nThis makes it the earliest black hole wind identified to date , extending the record by 100 million years , suggesting that feedback emerged relatively early in the history of the Universe .\nThat \u2019 s not the only thing that emerged early , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black hole clocks in at around 330 million times the mass of the Sun .\nBy studying the ALMA data , researchers were also able to measure the mass of J1243+0100 \u2019 s bulge .\nIt clocked in at 30 billion times the mass of the Sun , making the black hole \u2019 s mass proportional at roughly 10 percent that of the bulge .\nThis suggests that the coevolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies has also been occurring since at least a few hundred million years after the Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-precision computer simulations which have predicted that coevolutionary relationships were in place even at about 13 billion years ago , \u201d Izumi said .\n\u201c We are planning to observe a large number of such objects in the future , and hope to clarify whether or not the primordial coevolution seen in this object is an accurate picture of the general Universe at that time.\n\u201d The

of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant has kept track of a gradual spike in activity .\nThe rising count might be nothing .\nIt might even drop back down again , given time .\nScientists aren \u2019 t exactly keen on taking any chances , as the potential for a runaway nuclear fission reaction in the future can \u2019 t be ruled out until we know what \u2019 s going on .\nUnfortunately , the precise location of the decaying material beneath debris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigations and potential fixes all that more challenging .\nAs reported by Science Magazine \u2019 s Richard Stone , researchers at the Institute for Safety Problems of Nuclear Power Plants ( ISPNPP ) in Kyiv , Ukraine , are yet to determine whether the noted rise in neutrons heralds pending disaster , or is more of a storm in a nuclear tea-cup .\n\u201c There are many uncertainties , \u201d ISPNPP \u2019 s Maxim Saveliev told Stone .\n\u201c But we can \u2019 t rule out the possibility of [ an ] accident.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s most notorious nuclear accident , the Unit Four reactor at the Chernobyl complex underwent a devastating meltdown in late April , 1986 , following an unexpected drop in power during a key safety test .\nThe resulting explosions of compressed steam cast a pall of radioactive material far across Europe , contributing to the premature deaths of what could amount to tens of thousands of people .\nWithin the rooms and corridors of the demolished facility itself , super-heated uranium fuel collected in pools mixed with molten zirconium cladding , graphite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce a hellish lava that eventually solidified into monoliths of fuel-containing materials , or FCMs .\nOver the decades , uranium isotopes have continued to shoot off the occasional neutron from their nuclei .\nThose that happen to get close enough to another isotope \u2019 s nucleus risk upsetting their own delicate balance , driving free more neutrons .\nGiven a high enough concentration of atoms , the chain reaction of lost neutrons can generate enormous amounts of energy in a short amount of time , with potentially explosive consequences .\nNeutrons ejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atom typically move a little too fast to be easily captured .\nThis all changes when neutrons are forced to pass through certain media , such as water .\nSlowed down , they have a much higher chance of sticking to a nucleus and triggering its own decay .\nWith this in mind , it comes as little surprise that fission rates spike inside FCMs whenever they get wet .\nFor years , huddled beneath a hastily erected sarcophagus referred to as the Shelter , Unit Four \u2019 s ruins sat semi-exposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seep inside the tangled mess of collapsed concrete and old machinery .\nAmid fears that rainwater could send fission inside the FCMs into overdrive , engineers have managed to coat most of them in a neutron-absorbing solution of gadolinium nitrate .\nA more robust covering was completed over the

On April 28 , 2020 , two ground-based radio telescopes detected an of radio waves .\nIt only lasted a mere millisecond but , for astonished astronomers , it was a major discovery , representing the first time a fast radio burst ( FRB ) had ever been detected so close to .\nLocated just 30,000 light-years from our planet , the event was firmly within the , and it was , to all intents and purposes , almost impossible to miss .\n( CHIME ) and the Survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STARE2 ) certainly had no problems picking it up .\n\u201c CHIME wasn \u2019 t even looking in the right direction and we still saw it loud and clear in our peripheral vision , \u201d said Kiyoshi Masui , assistant professor of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .\n\u201c STARE2 also saw it , and it \u2019 s only a set of a few radio antennae literally made out of cake pans.\n\u201d Until that point , all FRBs had been observed outside our galaxy .\n\u201c They \u2019 ve been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them a lot harder to study , \u201d said doctoral candidate in physics Pragya Chawla from McGill University in Canada .\nApril 2020 \u2019 s discovery was also notable for being the most energetic radio blast that astronomers have ever recorded in the Milky Way , but what made it most exciting is that scientists are now closer to determining the origin of FRBs than at any point since they were first discovered .\nThat happened in 2007 , when Duncan Lorimer and David Narkevic were studying data taken by the Parkes radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so close to home has been the breakthrough astronomers have wished for ever since .\n\u201c We can learn more from a source that \u2019 s 30,000 light-years away than one that \u2019 s a billion or more light-years \u2019 distance , \u201d Masui affirms .\n\u201c We finally have a nearby source to study.\n\u201d One of the major problems with detecting FRBs , aside from most of them having been so far away , is that they are so fleeting .\nThey \u2019 ve been and gone in the blink of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more powerful than the sun \u2014 they can release as much energy in a few thousandths of a second as the sun in 100 years .\nIdeally , astronomers would discover an object and focus one or more different telescopes at it , but the ephemeral nature of these bursts removes any such opportunity .\nBut despite these challenges , astronomers have succeeded in building up a bank of knowledge about FRBs , most of which has been based on the dozens of recorded events from beyond our own galaxy .\nFor starters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of radio light lasting for microseconds to milliseconds .\n\u201c All-sky searches for them also suggest that thousands of these bursts occur in the sky every day , \u201d Chawla added .\nWe also know that most of them come from billions of light-years away .\nBut while dozens of models have been proposed to explain the origins of FRBs \u2014 with progenitors ranging from neutron stars to white dwarfs to cosmic strings \u2014 have any theories really prevailed ?\n\u201c Well , we know that they come from very small sources \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in size , \u201d Masui said .\n\u201c And the most likely sources are neutron stars since they are both very small and very energetic.\n\u201d The FRB discovered in the Milky Way is now helping astronomers to firm up such theories , and it \u2019 s become something of a breakthrough for scientists trying to get to the bottom of what is causing them .\nThanks to some nifty cosmic detective work involving the data of other telescopes monitoring the same patch of sky , observational evidence is now suggesting that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnetar , a type of young neutron star born from the embers of supernovas with a magnetic field 5,000 trillion times more powerful than Earth \u2019 s , thereby making them the universe \u2019 s most powerful magnets .\nBut how has this conclusion been drawn ?\nTo explain , we must consider the work that has gone into studying FRBs in relation to magnetars , which are known to emit high-energy electromagnetic radiation , notably and X-rays .\nBoth of these erupt in short-lived flares , and there has been speculation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a process that would pinpoint magnetars as the source for FRBs .\nWhen this latest FRB was discovered in our galaxy \u2014 known by astronomers as FRB 200428 \u2014 it was found to have originated in the constellation of Vulpecula , which just so happens to be where the galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 is located .\nIt was also accompanied by a burst of X-rays that further excited astronomers .\nThe first detection of X-rays from that sky region came the day before CHIME and STARE2 discovered FRB 200428 .\nThe Neil Gehrels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Telescope detected multiple X-ray and gamma-ray bursts coming from SGR 1935+2154 , which was known to exhibit transient radio pulsations .\nOther telescopes were also found to have observed an X-ray burst from SGR 1935+2154 \u2014 crucially , at the same time as the fast radio burst .\nThese included the Konus-Wind detector on board NASA \u2019 s GGS-Wind spacecraft and the European Space Agency \u2019 s INTEGRAL space telescope , both picking up an X-ray burst at the moment CHIME and STARE2 recorded the FRB .\nHow CHIME is used to discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment picked up on FRB 200428 .\nFor another check , attention turned to the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope ( FAST ) located in southwest China .\nThis fixed-diameter dish telescope detected a fast radio burst in the direction of FRB 200428 and put its location somewhere around SGR 1935+2154 , which further cemented the association between the X-ray source and fast radio bursts .\nThe latter was comparable to other FRBs found outside the Milky Way , adding to the body of evidence .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from the direction of a known magnetar within our galaxy and the radio burst happened at exactly the same time as an X-ray burst coming from the same magnetar , \u201d Masui said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a clue as to how magnetars produce FRBs , but the community is still trying to work out what it all means.\n\u201d What has become clear is that FRB 200428 is the first observed fast radio burst to send out emissions other than radio waves , and scientists have benefitted hugely from having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe detection of the X-ray burst at the same time as the radio burst confirmed a magnetar as the origin , and it \u2019 s the evidence astronomers have been looking for .\n\u201c The discovery of an FRB in our galactic neighborhood is significant because the proximity makes it a lot easier to follow up the source with telescopes observing at other wavelengths , \u201d Chawla said .\n\u201c None of the FRBs ever discovered have been known to emit at any other wavelengths , and this is the first detection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThese observations can probe the source environment in greater detail , providing clues about the origin of FRBs.\n\u201d CHIME in particular has proven to be an essential tool .\nBased at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory in Canada , it \u2019 s a novel radio telescope with no moving parts , and it has a high mapping speed thanks to its 200-square-degree field of view and broad frequency range of between 400MHz and 800MHz .\n\u201c Most radio telescopes aren \u2019 t able to pinpoint the location of an FRB well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object .\nThose that are able to localize FRBs with great precision usually look at small patches of sky , and can only observe a patch about the size of the full moon .\nThey are not able to monitor several known magnetars at once , \u201d Chawla said .\n\u201c CHIME , however , observes an area about 500 times larger , and it can therefore monitor all magnetars located in the northern sky every day , allowing us to detect a burst as rare as this one .\nIt combines its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that has allowed us to both detect this burst and associate it with a known object.\n\u201d It \u2019 s been revolutionary and has quickly become the main observer of FRBs , with a correlator supercomputer processing 13 terabits of raw data per second to produce a radio map of the sky .\n\u201c Our ability to detect far-off FRBs has improved dramatically over the past few years , \u201d Masui said .\n\u201c Between 2007 and 2017 roughly 50 FRBs were detected .\nIn the last two years , CHIME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible because of CHIME \u2019 s digitally driven design , where the light is focused using digital signal processing , making it able to see large swathes of the sky at once.\n\u201d But the case is not entirely closed on this mystery .\nSTARE2 \u2019 s trio of radio detectors were cobbled together by a student using household items .\nAs Chawla tells us , young , extragalactic magnetars form only one of the proposed models of FRBs .\nBursts from known magnetars in our own galaxy have never been observed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , for the purposes of the study into FRB 200428 , astronomers inferred that the burst they detected was 3,000 times brighter than any burst previously observed , thereby making the magnetar model for FRBs more plausible .\n\u201c The burst we saw was still less energetic than most extragalactic FRBs , so we can not say for sure whether magnetars can explain all FRBs , \u201d Chawla said of a burst that was a thousandth of the energy of any equivalent found outside the Milky Way .\nIt may be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that it \u2019 s simply a matter of this one being close enough to detect .\nBut when it comes to pinning the source of FRBs on magnetars , astronomers need to remember that they come in two guises : those that have repeating signals , which means they frequently generate the outbursts over and over again , and others that , like FRB 200428 , generate more infrequently .\nIt could be the case that infrequent FRBs are caused by magnetars and the frequent ones are caused by a different phenomena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could also mean that two types of magnetars may exist , causing the two different types of fast radio bursts , or even that the brightest FRBs are caused by objects other than magnetars .\nOnly further research will shed light on the answer , since all we can really say for sure is that at least some fraction of FRBs come from magnetars \u201c It \u2019 s been suspected for some time that magnetars might be the sources of FRBs , but this confirms it for at least some fraction of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , \u201d Masui said .\n\u201c But we still don \u2019 t know how magnetars create them \u2014 we know the \u2018 what \u2019 and next is the \u2018 how \u2019 : How do magnetars do it ?\n\u201d As such , it remains important to discover what powers an FRB to emit such energy \u2014 perhaps electrons interacting with magnetic fields creating an \u2018 engine \u2019 of sorts .\n\u201c We would be interested in determining how extreme the properties of these magnetars need to be to allow a burst from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d Chawla said .\n\u201c But the most interesting application of FRBs would be to use them as cosmological probes to study the distributions of electrons and magnetic fields in the universe with unprecedented detail.\n\u201d Astronomers will also continue to look at how X-ray emissions and these bright bursts of energy are able to occur at the same time .\n\u201c Whether or not all FRBs are created through the same mechanism is an outstanding question , and it \u2019 s subject to much debate among astronomers , \u201d said Masui @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear astronomers will be delving into the ongoing mystery of fast radio bursts for some time .\nSource link A \u201c strange signal \u201d is coming from the Milky Way .\nWhat is the cause ?", "author": "Debi Allison", "url":

but this is even more so when the New Moon falls in the creative sign of Leo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the things you want out of your life , allow this creation to come straight from the heart , and then put it out into the world , so it can be manifested into reality .\nSun conjunct Moon represents the end of one cycle and the beginning of another new 28-day cycle .\nIt gives an invigorating burst of energy and initiative .\nBut it also brings emotional balance , not irrationally emotional , and not too cold and calculating .\nSo this is an excellent time for making a fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or starting a new project .\nYou can also question old habits , behaviors , and beliefs as you search for new and inventive ways to make progress .\nNew Moon square Uranus brings sudden and unexpected change , instability , chaos , and revolution .\nAn unsettling feeling of impending change can make you feel excited but also restless , anxious , and nervous .\nThis , in turn , can lead to abruptness , unreliability , impulsiveness , rebelliousness , unpredictable behavior , rapid changes in direction , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amplify your ego and pride .\nYou may feel a strong urge to express your true inner self without restriction .\nBut willfulness and arrogance could easily lead to ego conflicts , especially if you take on superiors .\nThis is not a good time for impulsive changes , but you may have to react to change .\nAnd the best way to do this is with flexibility , creativity , and inventiveness .\nAvoid stubbornly sticking to routines if the universe is sending messages that you need to change .\nOpen-mindedness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new path with exciting possibilities and opportunities .\nBecause the August 8 new moon is the square to Uranus it brings sudden , unexpected change , impulsiveness , and rebellion .\nThis disruptive and challenging influence is not helped by the stars in the Head of the Lion , which gives cruelty and hard-heartedness .\nBut they also give courage when faced with a sudden change in circumstances .\nThe Influence of the August new moon lasts for four weeks up until September 6 new moon .\nThe best time to make changes @ @ @ @ @

factor or cause behind extreme narcissism .\nWhen parents say one thing , and then do another , it can cause the child \u2019 s psyche to become confused .\nThis is also because when your parents act erratic and unpredictable- you will likely pull back and mentally retreat .", "author": "Harley Manson", "url":

deny any wrongdoing .\nInstead , they will turn the blame around on you , and will not back off from their stance .\nEven if you bring proof to them of their wrongdoing , they will tell you that you are wrong .\nOver time , the gaslighter will continue to master the tactics that will wear you down .\nThey may start to realize what phrases and situations are working to their benefit , and they will come at you full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to bring outsiders in and make them believe you are crazy too .\nCodependency happens when we rely on our partners emotionally and psychologically .\nThey may isolate you from friends and family , or try to make you believe that you need them to feel validated and loved .\nTo keep you on their hook , they will cycle between idealization and devaluation .\nOne day they may make you feel on top of the world , almost like you are on a pedestal .\nOn other days , they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the bad spells , you may look back to the good times , and think \u201c Oh they are just having a bad day .\nThey do love me.\n\u201d By taking full control of you , the gaslighter will make you feel powerless .\nIn turn , their power will continue to grow ,

the cycle .\nYou may feel tempted to allow the abuse to continue because you are in love .\nBut the fact of the matter is , if someone is making you question your reality- they are toxic to your

nurturing environment , and trying to understand who they are as a person , is extremely important .\nIntroverts tend to be on the quiet side , and are usually deep thinkers .\nAs an introvert , I \u2019 ve always felt like an alien , especially in social situations .\nThankfully , my mother didn \u2019 t push me to be someone I am not , and she didn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was .\nIn turn , I was able to feel pretty comfortable with myself- even when I knew deep down I was different .\nIf you are raising an introverted child , please keep the following ten mistakes in mind , and try to avoid them as much as you can .\nWhile it may be tempting to try to change your child or make seemingly innocent comments , some things are best avoided .\n1 .\nForce them to talk to others .\nIt \u2019 s normal to encourage your child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but forcing them is a bad way to go about this .\nIn turn , forcing them will likely end up making them feel more anxious and uncomfortable , causing them to retreat inward even more .\nIf you have a highly introverted child that feels awkward in social situations , planning interactions for them isn \u2019 t going to help .\nWhile you may have the best intentions when you introduce them and guide their conversations with new people- it \u2019 s best to avoid this .\nWhy ?\nCalling them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to make them withdraw more .\n3 .\nWorrying about their lack of a big social circle .\nIt \u2019 s normal to worry about your kids .\nExtroverted parents may worry about their children because the world can be an extremely socially driven place .\nHowever , just because your child is an introvert doesn \u2019 t mean they won \u2019 t thrive in the world or life .\nThey will make friends , and they will handle themselves

that they should just completely retreat and stay to themselves .\n5 .\nPushing them beyond their limits .\nEveryone has limits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what \u2019 s best for your child .\nAnd while you may think that is to push them out of their shell and make them do uncomfortable things when they aren \u2019 t ready- it \u2019 s best not to do that .\nLet them know you are happy to help them in whatever regard they need- and encourage them to grow , but don \u2019 t push them or override their boundaries .\n6 .\nCall them out in front of others .\nPutting your introverted child on the spot is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socially anxious , and calling them out or putting them in a spot where they become the center of attention isn \u2019 t going to help them at all .\n7 .\nNot allow them downtime .\nEveryone needs downtime , but introverts especially do .\nIf you have planned a busy day for you and your child , make sure to plan downtime in as well , so they can unwind and refresh themselves .\n8 .\nIntroduce them as quiet or shy .\nAs tempting as it may be to introduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t .\nDoing so will inevitably make them feel put on the spot , and called out .\nYes , they might be different from others , but honestly , people will see that they are introverted , they don \u2019 t need a disclaimer .\n9 .\nCompare them to extroverted or talkative children .\nDon \u2019 t ever compare your child to anyone , but especially don \u2019 t compare your child to extroverted kids .\nComparing children to other people damage their self-esteem and will inevitably make them feel like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBeing too overprotective of them .\nBecause your child is quiet and introverted , you may feel compelled to protect them more than you would a child with a more passionate and extroverted demeanor .\nBut- it \u2019 s better to not treat them differently than anyone else .\nFurthermore , it \u2019 s one thing to be protective , but over sheltering any child may make them

to enforce the belief in Santa or come clean to your children has been a topic of much debate for some time , science has chimed in with a pretty valid point .\nAccording to psychologists , the belief in Santa may support cognitive development in your little ones .\nLying to your kids is generally not a great idea , however , in the case of Santa , this little white lie may be helpful .\nFor adults , the notion of a man in a red coat and hat flying through the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHowever , in children , the notion inspires wonder and creativity .\nChild psychiatrists at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York explained , \u201c I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s a bad thing for kids to believe in the myth of someone trying to make people happy if they \u2019 re behaving .\n\u201c Imagination is a normal part of development , and helps develop creative minds.\n\u201d And let \u2019 s not forget that St. Nicholas was an actual person who did deliver gifts to the poor .\nWhen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c It \u2019 s a real story , it \u2019 s a real value , and it \u2019 s something that inspires children.\n\u201d Lorber isn \u2019 t the only one who supports how beneficial the belief in Santa can be .\nAnother psychologist from the University of the Sunshine Coast , Rachael Sharman says , \u201c Believing in things that grown-ups don \u2019 t is a perfectly normal part of childhood , from fairies in the garden to monsters under the bed , \u201d continuing , she says , \u201c Believing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing.\n\u201d Sharman has been working and researching childhood brain development for 20 years .\nWhen discussing Santa , she says that children \u2019 s brains light up , creating dopamine pathways .\n\u201c They \u2019 re happy and busy , unwrapping and processing , anticipating the rest of the day , \u201d she said .\nIt \u2019 s only later in our childhood , around the age of 12 that we begin to differentiate between logic and fantasy , says Sharman , and science supports this .\nAnd when it comes down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only myth children buy into , he \u2019 s one of many .\nWhen you include the Easter Bunny , the tooth fairy , and their favorite fictional heroes , the list is honestly endless .\nEventually , kids slowly grow out of most of their magical beliefs and come to terms with reality when it \u2019 s time .\nAnd when you think about it , even as adults , we still house some magical beliefs .\nFrom the belief in ghosts , bigfoot , demons , aliens , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than letting go of magical beliefs , we merely replace old belief systems with new ones

relationships and even friendships .\nAs an example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin talking to someone , and you like them a lot .\nYou meet up a few times , hang out , and you start to sense a connection

and social psychologist explain that there are several likely culprits behind ghosting .\nShe includes convenience , faded attraction , undesirable interactions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , but she attributes dark triad traits as a likely culprit as well .\nThe Dark Triad is narcissism , Machiavellianism , and psychopathy traits that are present in one personality type .\nAnd research supports this notion , as a study carried out by Dr. Peter Jonason and his colleagues in 2021 found major links between the acceptance of ghosting and the Dark Triad .\nThe study included 341 participants , and upon surveying the group , they found that the most accepting of ghosting had traits of narcissism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghosting is pretty common , as another study carried out in 2018 that included 1,300 participants found that a quarter of the participants had been ghosted .\nOne-fifth of the group admitted to ghosting someone themselves .\nWhile the results of being ghosted can be pretty painful , in some cases , the person who ghosted doesn \u2019 t have bad intentions .\nAnd while it is painful , in some cases dropping contact with a toxic person , some believe there \u2019 s no better alternative .\nThink of it this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abusive and controlling , and you pick up on that within a few dates , for some the natural reaction would be to let go .\nI am not debating that ghosting is good , but DiDonato agrees that in many cases , the intention of ghosting isn \u2019 t to hurt .\nWith all things considered , I felt like the research was pretty fascinating , and
