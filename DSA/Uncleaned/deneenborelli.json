417,608 in 2019 shows that \u201c pay for performance \u201d is hard to come by in the Washington , D.C. bureaucracy .\nAs the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) at the National Institute of Health ( NIH ) , Fauci is supposedly the top infectious disease expert in the U.S. government with the goal to stop pandemics from reaching our shores .\nIn Congressional testimony , Fauci said the mission of NIAID includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases \u201d and his group \u201d \u2026 anticipates and responds to these threats.\n\u201d Essentially , Fauci was assigned to be the sentinel on the wall \u2013 the medical Paul Revere who would sound the alarm and warn the country of an emerging pandemic invasion .\nHowever , Fauci failed to meet the primary mission of NIAID because he diminished the threat posed by COVID-19 during the early stages of the pandemic .\nOn television from January 2020 through early March , Fauci consistently downplayed COVID-19 .\nFauci initiated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be worried about \u201d view ( on Jan. 21 , 2020 ) with Newsmax TV \u2019 s host Greg Kelly .\nHe continued this theme in many interviews , including during an early-March White House briefing where he gave the OK for young people to go on a cruise ( read my earlier commentary for more details ) .\nThe extent of Fauci \u2019 s inability to respond to the seriousness of COVID-19 was described in the New York Post over the China travel ban .\nAt the request of President Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to convince Fauci that the president \u2019 s China travel ban was warranted at a January 28 meeting .\nSo it was Navarro , a Harvard Ph.D. economist , who instructed Fauci on public health measures to protect Americans .\nLooking back it \u2019 s puzzling for Fauci to be so nonchalant regarding COVID-19 , especially since the personal and professional risk-benefit analysis resides in overplaying the risk and not minimizing it .\nOne possibility as to why this happened is that Fauci was too reliant on the World Health Organization ( WHO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the WHO spread misinformation about the ability of the virus to spread between humans .\nAnother possibility is Fauci viewed the threat as similar to the SARS pandemic \u2013 a naturally occurring virus that was not as highly contagious as COVID-19 .\nFinally , it \u2019 s also possible that Fauci was in denial because the NIH funded research on bat coronaviruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology ( WIV ) where an enhanced virus could have accidentally escaped .\nFauci discounted the possibility that COVID-19 was a result of a lab accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin hypothesis is getting more attention .\nFox News \u2019 s \u201c The Next Revolution \u201d host Steve Hilton \u2019 s investigative reports on the possible lab origin of COVID-19 raise some very compelling information leading to the possibility that Fauci could potentially be indirectly responsible for the pandemic .\nHilton reveals Fauci as an early advocate of gain of function research where scientists tinker with naturally occurring viruses and deliberately give them traits , such as the ability to infect human cells and/or give the virus the capability to spread through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not nefarious .\nThe objective is to make viruses more dangerous in the laboratory so scientists could find cures and vaccines if humans were to encounter naturally occurring viruses with lethal traits .\nHilton isn \u2019 t the first to raise the possibility COVID-19 was the result of a lab accident of an enhanced virus but he did an excellent job in summarizing abundant circumstantial evidence pointing to it with the added twist of showing details of Fauci \u2019 s NIAID funding research on bat coronaviruses at the WIV .\nThe Obama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function research in 2014 after a few laboratories apparently mishandled dangerous pathogens .\nThe moratorium was lifted in 2017 .\nHilton also claims NIAID bypassed the 2014 moratorium by sending money to EcoHealth Alliance which in turn funded the WIV for research including gain of function research on bat coronaviruses .\nNIH denied it funded gain of function research but the major point is researchers at the WIV genetically altered naturally occurring bat viruses to study them , according to Hilton .\nIt \u2019 s unknown what other types of experiments were conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFinding the truth will not be easy because China is being protective of the WIV .\nThe two outside groups looking into the origins of COVID-19 include Dr. Peter Daszak , the president of EcoHealth Alliance , who has an obvious conflict of interest .\nYet , accountability for Fauci is highly unlikely .\nPresident

conservatives , have \u201c Fauci Fatigue.\n\u201d His numerous TV interviews with too many conflicting statements over the past year and a half has eroded his credibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitch to get vaccinated is a turnoff to conservatives .\nOn MSNBC , Fauci interpreted the personal decision to avoid getting vaccinated is based on politics and said , \u201c Get over it .\nGet over this political statement .\nJust get over it and try and save the lives of yourself and your family.\n\u201d Scolding conservatives for not obeying his view is a sure way to get the opposite response .\nThe recent exchange between Fauci and Senator Rand Paul , R-Ky. , over the definition of gain-of-function research and Fauci @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institute of Virology during a Senate hearing will only further alienate conservatives .\nIn response to a question from Paul , Fauci got very agitated , aggressive , and essentially called the Senator a liar .\nHis entire demeanor , both tone and body language , was defensive which points to the weakness of his arguments .\nSubstantively , his carefully crafted answers regarding his role in funding the Wuhan laboratory illustrates Fauci \u2019 s willingness to cloak the truth .\nFauci \u2019 s denial that a scientific paper published by Chinese scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow definition of the research technique .\nAs Paul described , the Chinese scientists took a naturally occurring bat coronaviruses found in a cave in China and genetically manipulated the viruses to give them the ability to infect human cells .\nFauci completely rejected Paul \u2019 s assertion in a demeaning way saying , \u201c Senator Paul , you do not know what you are talking about , quite frankly , and I would like to say that officially.\n\u201d It was human intervention , not nature , that created a novel virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThat \u2019 s literally a gain-of-function .\nThe bottom line is the Chinese researchers were manipulating bat coronaviruses with financial support from Fauci and as proof as Paul mentioned , the Chinese publication gave credit to the National Institute of Health including the grant number .\nImportantly , the publication showed the Wuhan lab had the capability to create novel coronaviruses that can infect human cells .\nAdditional research projects conducted at the lab , possibly including the creation of SARS-COV2 , remains unknown .\nFauci \u2019 s wordsmithing to narrowly define @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinton \u2019 s statement during his grand jury testimony about Monica Lewinsky \u2013 \u201c It depends on what the meaning of the word \u2018 is \u2019 is.\n\u201d Evidence is mounting that Fauci Fatigue is contributing to vaccine hesitancy .\nA recent CBS News YouGov poll conducted July 14-17 on the pandemic and reasons for adults not getting the vaccines .\nAccording to the poll , 50 percent are not getting vaccinated because they don \u2019 t trust the government .\nThat \u2019 s ten points higher than in June where 40 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a meaningful increase in adults that don \u2019 t trust the science as a reason to avoid vaccinations .\nIn June , 33 percent didn \u2019 t trust the science but in July it shot up to 45 percent .\nTo summarize , increasing numbers of Americans don \u2019 t trust the government or the science .\nLogically , that makes Fauci \u2013 a government scientist \u2013 the worst person to convince individuals to get vaccinated .\nWhat \u2019 s remarkable is Fauci admitted he is not the best messenger for vaccinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nation , \u201d he acknowledged government messengers are not trusted .\nFauci said , \u201c \u2026 what \u2019 s going on right now is getting trusted messengers , not government officials like myself , but trusted messengers in the community to outreach to people.\n\u201d Despite knowing and admitting he is not a trusted source , Fauci continues to appear on numerous network and cable news stations .\nIf Biden really wants to increase the number of vaccinations , he will recognize Americans are suffering from Fauci Fatigue and remove Fauci as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information and vaccines .\nDr. Tom Borelli is a contributor to

originally posted at RealClearPolicy .\nFew would argue the United States , or any country for that matter , was prepared for the COVID-19 pandemic , even though , starting in 2003 , the U.S. devoted $ 5.6 billion to fund Project Bioshield , running through 2013 , and another $ 2.8 billion of funding through 2018 .\nProject Bioshield was designed to prepare the United States against a bio attack , including provisions for the stockpiling and distribution of vaccines .\nThough Covid-19 was a new virus , congressional testimony from 2003 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew \u2013 and when \u2013 about the family of viruses from which it originated .\n\u201c I am particularly interested in learning how Project BioShield would assist in addressing the current public health emergency created by the epidemic known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome [ SARS ] , \u201d said Tom Davis , chairman of the Committee on Government Reform .\n\u201c More than 2,000 suspected cases of this mysterious disease have been reported in 17 nations , including the United States , with 78 fatalities .\nSo far , there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deadly syndrome.\n\u201d Among those testifying to the committee in 2003 was Dr. Anthony Fauci , then and now the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases .\nFauci told the committee : SARS , standing for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome , has now spread through several countries , at least 17 countries .\nThere are over 2,200 cases , and about 80 deaths .\nThere have now been 100 cases in the United States in 27 states .\nThis is a new disease .\nIt is what we refer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerging infectious disease .\nThe data from the CDC and from other laboratories indicate that the corona virus , which is an interesting group \u2013 it is a very common virus .\nIt is what causes about 10 to 20 percent of the common colds .\nThere are two groups of corona viruses .\nThis is likely a member of a new third group .\nIt has not been definitively demonstrated that this is the , or the only , cause of SARS , but the evidence is mounting every day from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAccording to testimony in 2003 , Fauci confirmed SARS was an emerging infectious disease of which data indicated it was tied to the coronavirus , the cause of 10-20 percent of common colds .\n\u201c It has the capability of being a very severe syndrome , \u201d Fauci continues .\n\u201c The death rate in this is 3.5 percent , which may sound small , but when you think about the possibility of infecting hundreds of millions of people , this can turn out to be a major public health threat .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ world it already is leading to such draconian measures as quarantines and isolation in several countries.\n\u201d Fauci continues : \u201c The CDC has done a magnificent job thus far , \u201d Fauci said in 2003 , \u201c and we know that they will continue to , in not only identifying and tracking but essentially now moving ahead in collaboration with the NIH and a variety of other agencies , the FDA , in developing diagnostic therapeutics and on our way to a vaccine.\n\u201d How is it that in 2003 , Fauci @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NIH , was doing a magnificent job and would work toward therapeutics and an eventual vaccine \u2013 and yet this country was basically blindsided , with few known therapeutics and no vaccine , 17 years later ?\nThe medical advice that became the norm and remains the norm in many parts of the United States is , if you become infected with COVID-19 , stay home , and wait to see if you get sicker .\nLooking back on Fauci \u2019 s words , it appears our health officials missed the mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning : in 2003 , it was disclosed that monoclonal antibodies have changed the way we treat everything from heart disease to cancer \u2013 yet such treatments were not being pushed like they are now .\nFauci \u2019 s words throughout the 2003 hearing are troubling in light of where we are today with COVID-19 .\n\u201c So , in summary , Mr. Chairman , it is a serious threat , \u201d Fauci said then of SARS .\n\u201c We must take it very seriously .\nWe don \u2019 t feel there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we must continue to do the very stringent public health measures that we are approaching , as well as the research that is going into it.\n\u201d Congressman Henry Waxman asks Fauci : \u201c Is there a potential for dual-use where the research of biodefense may well lead us to research breakthroughs for other diseases ?\n\u201d \u201c I think it is not only a potential , Mr. Waxman , I think it is inevitable that there will be an important contribution to the research that we put into emerging and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research , and it is without a doubt that the research that goes into biodefense will help us with naturally occurring , \u201d Fauci responds .\n\u201c Because as a matter of fact , as we have discussed before , as you know we feel that deliberately released microbes is just another form of emerging and reemerging disease .\nInstead of occurring naturally , it is done with malice and deliberately , but the end result can be the same.\n\u201d While Fauci has been extremely reluctant to admit that gain-of-function research was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that China was responsible for the release of the COVID-19 virus , his 2003 testimony makes clear that he felt deliberately released microbes were just another form of emerging and reemerging disease .\nThe bottom line : the United States was not prepared for COVID-19 , and the draconian measures to handle it that have been pushed by Fauci from March 2020 on have not resulted in declining mortality numbers \u2013 in fact , the trend we are seeing is more deaths in the last 10 months than in all of 2020 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ known for years the serious threat the United States and the world faced from coronaviruses , and it appears he did very little in the last 17 years to address the very concerns he raised about them in his testimony in 2003 , Dr. Fauci should resign \u2013 in disgrace .\nKirk Allen and John Kraft are founders of the Edgar County Watchdogs and American Watchdogs , nonprofits

permanent elimination of the SSN requirement means that even illegal immigrants whose children are also illegally in the country can receive the new expanded credit .\nIf the reconciliation bill is passed , we now estimate illegal immigrants whose children are also illegally in the country will receive $ 2.3 billion from the new CTC , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash payments to illegal immigrant parents .\nThis includes illegal migrants here in 2020 and those stopped and then released into the country in 2021 .\nThese payments are not related to the huge cash settlements the administration is planning to pay illegal immigrant families separated at the border during the Trump administration .\nReceipt of payments under the new CTC would be all the easier because reconciliation also eliminates the work requirement of the old ACTC for next year .\nIn the past , some illegal immigrants who worked off the books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dropping the work requirement makes it even simpler for them to receive payments .\nThese payments represent an enormous inducement to illegal immigration .\nWe estimate that 78 % of illegal immigrants with children have income low enough to receive cash payments averaging $ 5,300 per family , or about $ 2,600 per child next year .\nTo place these numbers in perspective , the median income in the current top illegal immigrant-sending countries of Honduras , Guatemala , and El Salvador is $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 a year .\nThe cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who arrives with a child , whether they work in the United States or not , is roughly equal to \u2014 or in some cases exceeds \u2014 what migrants could earn in their home countries in one year .\nIn addition to creating large costs for taxpayers and encouraging illegal immigration , the elimination of the SSN requirement would seem to be an invitation to fraud , as tax filers now simply need to provide a name and date of birth for a child .\nThe only other requirement is that they check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in the United States for half a year , though there is no enforcement mechanism for this provision .\nPartly in response to a 2011 report from the Inspector General for Tax Administration showing that illegal immigrants made extensive use of tax credits , Congress included provisions in both the 2015 PATH Act and the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act designed to restrict illegal immigrant receipt of such programs .\nThis included the requirement that the qualifying child have an SSN .\nThe budget reconciliation effectively undoes those changes .\nTo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to America do in fact work .\nBut the welfare benefits we give to them certainly incentivizes even more illegal immigration .\nThe list of things we have failed to do to enforce our immigration laws is so long that it can \u2019 t even be summarized here .\nBut if we want to understand why a record 1.7 million people were apprehended at the border in FY 2021 , we need to look no further than the large cash payments

budget-busting \u201c Build Back Better Act \u201d ( BBBA ) , the legislation \u2019 s massive expansion of federal Medicaid funding for in-home care has thus far received little scrutiny .\nUnfortunately , the legislation is cynically engineered to steer potentially billions of Medicaid dollars to labor unions , forcing hundreds of thousands of home care aides into supporting far-left political advocacy and saddling taxpayers with wasteful programs .\nMedicaid has long paid for eligible adults with functional disabilities to receive long-term care .\nRecent decades have seen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ client \u2019 s home , a model which minimizes costs and maximizes the client \u2019 s independence compared to institutionalized settings .\nBeginning in the 1990s , home care aides serving Medicaid clients became the target of union organizing campaigns .\nHundreds of thousands of Medicaid-paid caregivers in at least eight states are now unionized , generating about $ 150 million in dues for unions like SEIU and AFSCME in 2017 alone .\nMost of these caregivers are related to their clients .\nBecause they work in homes ( often their own ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of traditional workplace representation from their unions , despite paying as much as $ 1,000 per year in dues .\nIn 2014 , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Harris v. Quinn that the First Amendment protects \u201c quasi-public employees , \u201d like Medicaid caregivers contracting directly with the state , from being required to pay union dues .\nEver since , unions have sought to circumvent the ruling at every turn .\nIn 2018 , Washington state lawmakers adopted union-backed legislation to privatize the home care workforce , transforming caregivers from \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private company who , in Washington and 22 other states lacking right-to-work protections , could be forced to pay union fees .\nCaregivers spoke out strongly against the legislation , to no avail .\nAs one mom fighting SEIU to preserve her rights put it , \u201c They \u2019 re so huge .\nThey \u2019 re so big\u2026 How are we going to go up against a giant like that ?\n\u201d Hundreds of thousands of caregivers may find themselves asking the same question if the BBBA becomes law .\nFollowing Washington \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an increase in Medicaid funds on states \u2019 adopting an \u201c agency with choice \u201d model for their HCBS programs , precisely the arrangement put in place by Washington lawmakers to circumvent Harris .\nThough legally permissible , the Department of Health and Human Services under both the Obama and Trump administrations promoted different arrangements that , by avoiding a middleman employer between clients and their caregivers , offer clients greater \u201c flexibility and empowerment.\n\u201d That appears to matter little to the BBBA \u2019 s backers .\nWhile the legislation \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about caring for seniors and the disabled , at least Rep. Robin Kelly ( D-IL ) had the temerity to acknowledge the BBBA would boost \u201c organizations like SEIU.\n\u201d Unfortunately , the BBBA also seeks to propagate Washington \u2019 s union-dominated home care model by paying union affiliates to run training and other programs for caregivers .\nWashington \u2019 s experience shows these programs are plagued by cronyism , waste , and a lack of accountability .\nThe state pays an SEIU-affiliated nonprofit to administer one of the most onerous training programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn addition to providing SEIU with membership recruitment opportunities , it consistently spends less on training than it is paid , producing steadily increasing assets .\nDespite receiving hundreds of millions of Medicaid dollars , Washington \u2019 s Democrat state auditor has documented how the training discourages recruitment and has failed to solve high turnover .\nThe auditor even postulated that reducing training requirements might boost recruitment but stopped short of making formal recommendations because no data shows the effectiveness of the training in improving client care in the first place .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits trust for caregivers has accumulated assets several times larger than the reserves recommended by its own consultants , simply because it can .\nThrough Medicaid , Washington pays another SEIU affiliate to help connect clients seeking care to caregivers looking for work \u2014 a function the state already performs .\nA Medicaid-funded but union-operated retirement fund took four years and $ 110 million before it started paying out modest benefits to caregivers .\nAnd , cumulatively , these entities pay millions to the local SEIU affiliate , ostensibly for administrative services .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington \u2019 s payroll costs for caregivers wind up going to SEIU .\nBy seeking to replicate Washington state \u2019 s model around the country , the BBBA has the potential to steer billions of dollars in Medicaid funds into the treasuries of unions with few obligations to their members but a comprehensive political agenda .\nThere \u2019 s simply no excuse for allowing unions to rig Medicaid for their own enrichment at the expense of caregivers , Medicaid beneficiaries and taxpayers alike .\nAny additional HCBS funding Congress sees fit to appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these strings

doesn \u2019 t have enough money , when the simplest definition of inflation \u2013 now at a 30-year high \u2013 is too much money chasing too few goods .\nPresident Biden has convinced himself that the way to increase the number of goods is to inject even more money into the economy .\nBut if we could spend our way out of our inflationary problem , we would not be in one to begin with .\nAccording to budget expert Brian Riedl , over the past two years Washington has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending to combat Covid-19 and support the economy .\nThat doesn \u2019 t even count the $ 550 billion for the infrastructure bill that Congress just passed or the sharp spike in discretionary spending that would increase the budget baseline by $ 1 trillion over the next decade .\nOn top of that , the Federal Reserve has been buying up $ 120 billion worth of Treasury and housing-backed securities every month .\nInitially , Biden and his team insisted that the inflation Americans were experiencing was \u201c transitory , \u201d but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become obvious that inflation is here to stay .\nBiden is blaming inflation on the standard left-wing bogeyman \u2013 the energy sector .\n\u201c The largest share of the increase in prices in this [ inflation ] report is due to rising energy costs , \u201d the president recently told Americans , adding that he had asked the Federal Trade Commission to deal with \u201c market manipulation or price gouging in this sector.\n\u201d This move attempts to deflect attention from the administration \u2019 s responsibility for higher oil and gas prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the domestic fossil fuel industry through policies like killing the Keystone XL pipeline and ( illegally ) banning oil and gas development on federal lands .\nThese policies have worked to chill investment and development .\nWith demand rising , output of oil and gas should be booming , but it \u2019 s still well below pre-pandemic levels .\nJust two years ago , the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that the United States had become the world \u2019 s top producer of oil and natural gas .\nNow , having hamstrung the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration has been reduced to pleading with OPEC+ ( which includes adversaries such as Russia , Iran , and Venezuela ) to increase oil production .\nOPEC+ refused , an embarrassing setback that puts the lie to the administration \u2019 s claim that \u201c America is respected around the world again.\n\u201d A gallon of gasoline costs $ 1.29 more today than it did this time last year .\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts that this winter Americans will be paying 30 % more for natural gas , 43 % more for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electricity , and 54 % more for propane to heat their homes than they did last winter \u2013 and even more if the weather is colder than normal .\nHigher energy costs have a disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations , including minority and low- and fixed-income households .\nThese costs are essentially a regressive tax on the poor .\nWhen Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm was asked what her plan was to increase domestic oil and gas production and lower prices , she responded , \u201c That is hilarious .\nWould that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But as you know , of course , oil is a global market .\nIt is controlled by a cartel .\nThat cartel is called OPEC.\n\u201d If OPEC \u2019 s decision not to increase production is the culprit , then why is the administration threatening to go after gas stations instead of finding ways to increase domestic output ?\nMeantime , the president \u2019 s Build Back Better plan is chock-full of Green New Deal-type energy policies that would result in even higher energy costs to American families .\nMake no mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices are a feature , not a bug .\nWhite House spokesperson Jen Psaki recently gave the game away when she said , \u201c Our view is that the rise in gas prices over the long term makes an even stronger case for doubling down our investment and focus on clean energy options.\n\u201d The administration sees higher energy costs not as a problem but as an opportunity .\nSince it can not bring down the price of renewables to compete with oil and gas , it needs higher oil and gas prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has , the administration wrings its hands and complains , or tries to sic the FTC on \u201c price gougers.\n\u201d The United States has enjoyed a competitive advantage because of its lower energy costs .\nAmerican industries pay anywhere from two to four times less for energy than industries in Europe .\nThe Biden administration is pursuing policies that would surrender that advantage by saddling energy producers and consumers alike with more regulations and taxes .\nPresident Biden is sure that spending trillions more taxpayer dollars on his Build Back Better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounting inflation problem .\nHe \u2019 s wrong : it will only make things

said that her kids were falling behind in fundamental skills and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a public school .\nHer children \u2019 s teachers were unable to address their individual needs .\nLike many

learning needs .\nTake , for example , Demetria Zinga , who has been cited as one of the country \u2019 s top black homeschool bloggers and YouTubers .\nZinga notes that homeschooling allows parents to choose and discard a curriculum depending on whether it is working for their child .\n\u201c So , \u201d she says , \u201c we might try something for a season and then realize that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then try something different.\n\u201d Her oldest daughter , Nyomi , learned best with a more structured program , so Zinga chose Classical Conversations , a curriculum that emphasizes skills of recitation , logical thinking , and persuasive rhetoric .\nNyomi said that the curriculum required lots of reading and writing , but \u201c it was helpful to make me a better writer.\n\u201d She graduated from the Classical Conversations program with honors .\nBy contrast , Zinga \u2019 s younger daughter , Zoe , is artsy , theatrical , and entrepreneurial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her .\nTo meet the varying demands of homeschool parents like Zinga , hundreds of curriculum choices are now in the marketplace .\nParents also have tools to make informed decisions as to what will work best for their children .\nFor instance , homeschoolers have long relied on curriculum expert Cathy Duffy and her website for reviews of materials .\nHer book \u201c 102 Top Picks for Homeschool Curriculum \u201d is a much-used guide for homeschool parents .\nIn addition , homeschool academies at charter schools stock a wide array of curricula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carter , head of a homeschool academy at Natomas Charter School in Sacramento , says that parents can also request a curriculum not stocked at the academy .\nAs long as it meets certain requirements , she says , \u201c then we order it and sometimes we add it to the selection for everyone.\n\u201d With a curriculum better suited for their needs , homeschooled children generally do better academically than their public school peers .\nAccording to

Democrats to sacrifice their stated principles and resort to brazen gimmicks in order to fit it into the reconciliation bill , look no further than the latest release of the IRS \u2019 s tax migration data , covering tax years 2018-2019 .\nThe data shows that certain states continue to alienate their own tax bases with punitively high taxes and uncompetitive business tax environments .\nHigh-tax states are losing taxpayers at an alarming rate , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are benefiting from their fellow states \u2019 loss .\nThe five states that lost the most taxpayers are not exactly known for

8.96 percent .\nUnsurprisingly , Florida is the big winner here , adding $ 17.5 billion in AGI to its tax base alone .\nBut this phenomenon of taxpayers fleeing states that treat them like boundless sources of tax revenue is nothing new , and high-tax states aren \u2019 t learning their lessons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered by this data , New Jersey and New York have passed major income tax increases , while the other three states that lost the most taxpayers are seriously considering doing the same .\nAnd even with never-ending tax increases , many of these states are in dire fiscal straits

back on spending rather than blissfully continuing down this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit in well among their policymakers .\nInstead , they \u2019 re counting on a reinstituted SALT deduction to pass the tax burden they place on their residents onto taxpayers elsewhere .\nOf the 10 counties that saw the largest benefit from the SALT deduction before it was capped , nine are in the five states that

at RealClearPolitics.com As supply chain woes continue to ravage the U.S. economy , policymakers in both parties are recognizing the dire consequences of America \u2019 s dependence on foreign manufacturing .\nThe implications extend beyond the economic sphere .\nThe COVID-19 pandemic underscored manufacturing \u2019 s essential role in ensuring our health , safety , and national security .\nThe decline of U.S. manufacturing output has coincided with increasingly aggressive state-subsidized production in other countries , leaving many to wonder whether the power of America \u2019 s private sector alone can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China is not alone in its use of state planning to boost production of critical supplies .\nIn the semiconductor industry , subsidies account for up to 70 % of the cost differential between a chip fabrication facility in the U.S. and one based in China , Taiwan , or South Korea .\nThe debate over how best to balance our free market ideals with the demands of international competition is as old as America itself .\nIn his 1791 \u201c Report on Manufactures , \u201d Alexander Hamilton urged congressional action to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons .\nIn the ensuing 230 years , our country has engaged in a tug-of-war between industrial policy and a purely laissez-faire approach .\nThe way we choose to strike this balance today will determine not just our economic vitality and national security , but also the example we set for the free world .\nTo grapple with these issues , we at the Ronald Reagan Institute convened a Task Force on National Security and Manufacturing Competitiveness made up of leaders from both parties and a range of critical industries .\nAfter spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges , our task force released a report last week concluding that if America is to prevail in this competition , it must be through our free , open , and values-based economy \u2014 but that government has a role to play in enabling its success .\nThe task force identified six core challenges affecting U.S. manufacturing : a significant workforce skills gap , inadequate capital investment , unsatisfactory productivity gains , a fragile supplier ecosystem , insufficient coordination across government , and inadequate architecture for international cooperation .\nNone of these challenges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone ; nor can they be solved by top-down industrial policy .\nThey require a federal policy agenda that empowers our private sector to do in this century what it did in the last : design , build , and produce the supplies critical to our economy and national security .\nThe technical skills gap in manufacturing provides a case study in the need for more effective public policy to support industry , especially when it comes to small- and medium-size firms that lack the resources to invest in training programs .\nWhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their talent pipelines through partnerships with community colleges and credentialing and training programs , their efforts are often localized .\nIndustry rarely shares best practices across companies or regions .\nGovernment can help by serving as an investor , partner , and coordinator of efforts .\nOur task force urges the federal government to incentivize private investment in the talent pipeline by offering an outcome-based reimbursement and matching program for firms that invest in accredited education programs .\nIt also recommends allowing employers to compete for federal funding that traditionally subsidizes college degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and internships to build careers and the workforce .\nAt the same time , the task force urges U.S. manufacturing firms to focus their ESG ( environmental , social , and governance ) efforts on workforce development by funding 500,000 trade school and apprenticeship programs over the next decade .\nSimilarly , public and private efforts can be combined to address inadequate capital investment in manufacturing .\nWhile other nations pair state subsidies with government control , our task force recommends standing up a new public-private investment entity designed to provide necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis could take multiple forms , including a new government-sponsored investment entity like the proposed Industrial Finance Corporation , changes to existing institutions such as the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation , direct bond buying programs , a sovereign fund , or private capital funds focused on the on-shore manufacturing ecosystem .\nWhatever the mechanism , the focus must be on empowering private markets rather than controlling them .\nTwo of the challenges identified by the task force \u2014 insufficient coordination across government and inadequate architecture for international cooperation \u2014 fall squarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the report is the focus on government \u2019 s role in promoting a strong , independent private sector .\nA key example of this is the proposal to modernize the Defense Production Act to enable holistic support for manufacturers , including through targeted visa approvals for STEM talent , direct project financing , automatic fast-tracking for permitting , and additional support for workforce training initiatives .\nThe United States can not prevail in today \u2019 s global competition by becoming more like our authoritarian rivals .\nRather , we must become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFrom World War II to the Cold War , America secured victory in the last century by synchronizing the strength of our democratic principles with the dominance of our private innovators .\nSo it must be today .\nOur federal government must take targeted action to enable our businesses and workers to do what they do best : conceive , create , and produce the supplies America needs to remain the freest and most prosperous nation on earth .\nRoger Zakheim is the director of the Ronald Reagan Institute .", "author":

Platform Transparency Could Help Build Antitrust Cases", "content": "There is growing bipartisan concern over the power Silicon Valley \u2019 s oligopolies wield over American society .\nAmazon alone controls 72 % of U.S. adult book sales , Airbnb accounts for a fifth of domestic lodging expenditures and Facebook accounts for almost three-quarters of social media visits .\nJust two companies , Apple and Google , act as gatekeepers to 99 % of smartphones , while two others , Uber and Lyft , control 98 % of the ride-share market in the U.S .\nYet , for government to take robust antitrust action against Silicon Valley requires the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harm this market consolidation inflicts on consumers .\nA new RealClearFoundation report offers a look at how amending Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to require platform transparency could aid such antitrust efforts .\nWhen it comes to Silicon Valley \u2019 s social media platforms , they have long argued that antitrust laws don \u2019 t apply to them because their services are provided free of charge .\nIn reality , users do pay for their services : with their data rather than their money .\nCompanies today harvest vast amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , using that data to invisibly nudge their users toward purchases and consuming ads , or the companies simply sell that data outright .\nThe question must be asked : If the amount and intimacy of that data increases alongside a company \u2019 s market dominance , are antitrust conditions of rising \u201c prices \u201d satisfied ?\nMoreover , that same data is being increasingly used to determine what we pay for goods and services through \u201c differential pricing.\n\u201d In 2000 , when Amazon experimented with charging different users different prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences were randomly selected rather than personalized ) , it had just 20 million users .\nToday Amazon \u2019 s market share stands at more than 40 % , and while the company states it does not employ \u201c differential pricing , \u201d e-commerce platforms increasingly base pricing on factors as diverse as search history , home address , in-store vs. online and even Mac vs. PC usage , to name just a few .\nAs major brands like Target also move toward contextual pricing , it is only a matter of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it .\nBeyond price , the growing consolidation within entire industries to just a handful of companies means the policies of those companies can have outsized economic impacts on American life , often in unexpected ways .\nIn 2019 , I asked Uber how it ensured that the ratings its drivers assign to passengers did not unfairly penalize older and disabled riders who require additional time to enter and exit vehicles , given that low ratings can result in being banned from the service .\nA spokesperson pointed to its non-discrimination policy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community guidelines explicitly require that riders \u201c always try to be on time for your ride \u2026 because nobody likes to wait \u201d ; the spokesperson did not comment further when pressed on the impact of this policy on the disabled .\nLast month , the Department of Justice sued Uber for charging wait fees to disabled users in violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act .\nSimilarly , in 2018 I asked Facebook to explain why it built its advertising system to allow housing , employment and credit advertisements to explicitly exclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violation of federal law and its own policies , cutting them off from economic opportunities .\nA spokesperson emphasized that it was responsibility of advertisers to comply with discrimination laws and did not comment further when asked why it did not simply remove those options for protected ad classes .\nIt was not until the following year , after settling a series of lawsuits by civil rights organizations , that the company finally removed the ability of advertisers to exclude legally protected groups from seeing housing , employment and credit ads .\nYet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company \u2019 s algorithms had learned to continue targeting ads based on those removed categories by identifying non-protected demographic and interest information that were highly correlated with them .\nUber \u2019 s decision to charge a \u201c wait time \u201d fee meant higher costs for the disabled across 69 % of the American ride-share market .\nFacebook \u2019 s decision to allow housing , employment and credit ads to explicitly target or exclude users based on age , race and gender and to resurrect redlining using pinpoint geo-fencing , impacted the economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults .\nA common theme among all of these examples , from Amazon \u2019 s 2000 pricing experiment to Uber and Facebook \u2019 s discriminatory policies , is that they came to light not through voluntary disclosures by the companies , but rather through external scrutiny and data .\nYet , these discoveries remain the exceptions .\nDespite their vast internal stores of data , the companies typically refuse to confirm even the most basic of statistics , such as the number of tweets sent each day or the criteria their algorithms use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were forced to share basic pricing information ?\nAfter the federal government required hospitals to begin sharing their previously confidential pricing data by earlier this year , journalists and researchers have been able to document substantial differences between what different patients pay for the same procedure , offering critical insights to policymakers .\nImagine if all e-commerce sites with more than a certain number of users were forced to publish hourly snapshots of the maximum and minimum prices they charged for each item on their site , allowing similar external scrutiny .\nSuch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent competitive misuse while still offering critical transparency into just how much of an impact differential pricing is having on American consumers .\nSimilarly , what if \u201c free \u201d ad-supported platforms with more than a certain number of users had to offer each of their users a monthly report detailing every purchase , sale or collection of their personal data and how much money , including ad revenue , they made from that user and all of the companies and governments that purchased access to their data ?\nThis would allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our data that we essentially barter for access to these platforms is steadily increasing and would provide evidence as to whether the hidden price we pay for social platforms is steadily increasing .\nAs foreshadowed by TikTok , future top social media and e-commerce platforms may not be American companies or even have a physical or financial presence in the U.S. , complicating antitrust enforcement .\nMaking these transparency requirements an amendment to Section 230 would ensure disclosure even for such companies , providing critical visibility for policymakers to understand their impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , antitrust regulation will struggle until policymakers and the public can see for the first time the true economic cost of Silicon Valley \u2019

Chisholm \u2019 s sympathy for the criminal class and apparent indifference to those who obey the rules of civilized society reflect the philosophy of the billionaire investor who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many other progressive district attorneys across America : George Soros .\nIt \u2019 s no secret that Soros , with an estimated net worth of $ 8.6 billion , has been financing a multitude of progressive-left politicians and causes for years .\nIt \u2019 s also no secret that electing radical , criminal-friendly district attorneys is at the top of his list of priorities .\nSoros-backed DAs in major U.S. cities have instituted brazenly lax enforcement policies that have helped unleash an unprecedented wave of crime across urban America .\nWaukesha is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the not-so-invisible hand of George Soros is fundamentally redefining law enforcement across America , to the detriment of everyone , except criminals .\nLast week it was reported that 12 major U.S. cities have already posted record-setting murder rates in 2021 .\nWABC-Radio has identified three additional metropolises \u2014 Chicago , Milwaukee , and Jackson , Miss .\n\u2014 that have also set murder records this year , all with Soros-backed DAs .\nThis follows an analysis by WABC-Radio of 13 U.S. cities with Soros-backed district attorneys .\nThe investigation focused on homicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime , \u201c As a readily measurable indicator , homicide is both a reasonable proxy for violent crime and a robust indicator of levels of violence within States.\n\u201d It \u2019 s important to understand , first , why Soros chose the office of district attorney as his vehicle for social change .\nThe traditional means of effectuating such change within the American system is through the legislative process .\nBut Soros , the man who brought the Bank of England to its knees in 1992 when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made $ 1 billion in the process \u2013 knows how to identify and exploit his prey \u2019 s point of greatest vulnerability .\nIn this case , his prey is America \u2019 s criminal-justice system .\nThe legislative process is messy , expensive , and uncertain , so Soros reasoned that he could use his overwhelming financial resources more effectively to elect hand-picked district attorneys who share his extreme views .\nOnce in office , these officials could apply the power of selective enforcement to the law , deciding who gets charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical insight has made Soros a powerful force in cities across the nation , according to former New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly : \u201c George Soros is a major cause for the systematic decline of American law enforcement .\nThe mindset of his DAs \u2014 that criminals are victims \u2014 has done immeasurable harm , especially to poor minorities in our inner cities .\nMeanwhile , the complex network of nonprofits Soros uses to disperse his funds makes it nearly impossible to track what he \u2019 s doing to undermine our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his foundation is called The Open Society Institute , yet his anti-law-enforcement programs are deliberately designed to avoid public scrutiny.\n\u201d Working from publicly available records , WABC-Radio analyzed the impact of Soros-backed DAs on urban murder rates \u2014 what we call \u201c The Soros Effect.\n\u201d And while other factors may be at play in these times of COVID-19 and social unrest , the appalling numbers that define Soros cities speak for themselves .\nFrom 2019 to 2020 , America experienced a record 30 % increase in homicides .\nUsing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we analyzed 13 cities with Soros-backed DAs \u2013 or , in the case of Phoenix , a Soros-backed sheriff .\nThe Soros Effect is the projected difference \u2013 the delta \u2013 between the 30 % rise in murders that occurred in the U.S. overall , and the additional rise in murders experienced by the Soros cities .\nIt \u2019 s worth noting that most of these cities were already among the nation \u2019 s most violent before their Soros-backed DAs took office .\nThese cities had already reached a theoretical saturation point in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with criminal-friendly , anti-bail Soros DAs in place , they achieved even higher rates of murder and violence .\nConsider Philadelphia , whose Soros-backed DA , Larry Krasner , ran as an anti-establishment candidate with a history of suing the city \u2019 s police department \u2014 75 times \u2014 and defending progressive causes such as Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter .\nIn Krasner \u2019 s first year in office , 2018 , Philadelphia \u2013 already one of the nation \u2019 s deadliest cities \u2013 posted a 11.3 % increase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia sustained a 41.4 % rise in murders ( 11.4 % greater than the rest of the nation ) , resulting in 40 more deaths than the city would have suffered had Philly merely kept pace with the rest of the nation in that record-setting year .\nThe punishing impact of the Soros Effect continues in 2021 , with Philadelphia on pace to reach 549 murders by year \u2019 s end \u2013 a 10 % increase over 2020 , representing a historic high for the so-called City of Brotherly Love .\nThe storyline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Soros helped fund the election of super-progressive Cook County DA Kimberly Foxx .\nIn 2019-2020 , Chicago homicides rose an astonishing 52.7 % , from 505 to 771 , representing 115 more murders than if the Windy City had maintained the nation \u2019 s already-blistering pace .\nUnder Foxx \u2019 s supervision , Chicago will likely end 2021 with 848 murders \u2013 on a proportional basis , a record for Chicago , which has lost 600,000 residents since 1974 , when the last record was set .\nThe deadly drumbeat of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its Soros DA , Jackson , Miss.\n, saw a 53.7 % spike in murders from 2019 to 2020 , when it notched a record 128 homicides .\nIn 2021 , the city \u2019 s murder record has already been broken , with Jackson on course to log 141 murders by year \u2019 s end .\n*Milwaukee , the metro area which includes Waukesha , saw a jaw-dropping 94 % rise in murders from 2019 to 2020 , when it posted a record 190 .\nThe bad news continues in 2021 , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200 murders , and that \u2019 s before the final December report .\n*Metro Orlando got hammered with a 39 % increase from 2019 to 2020 .\nPhoenix saw a 44 % rise from 2019 to 2020 .\n*St. Louis , already burdened with the nation \u2019 s highest murder rate , suffered an additional 35 % rise from 2019 to 2020 .\n*Hyper-violent Shreveport , La.\n, witnessed a 78.4 % increase for the 2019-2020 period .\n*Los Angeles , with its super-woke DA , George Gasc\u00f3n , is on track to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through 2021 .\n*Liberal-hip Austin , having elected Soros-backed DA Jose Garza only a year ago , is now on pace to close 2021 with a record 89 homicides \u2013 a staggering 85.4 % increase over 2020 .\n*Albuquerque , N.M. \u2019 s murder rate is on course , through the close of 2021 , to register an 89 % increase since 2018 , when its Soros DA , Raul Torrez , took office .\n*Baltimore , America \u2019 s second-most deadly city , experienced a horrific 63 % increase in murders in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marilyn Mosby took command .\nIt has stayed at that deadly level ever since and will likely close out 2021 with 346 murders .\n*Under super-progressive , Soros-backed DA Chesa Boudin , San Francisco is projected to end 2021 with 57 murders \u2013 a 39 % increase since 2019 .\nIn addition , a wave of smash-and-grab mass robberies has shaken the city to its liberal core and unraveled any conventional notion of civil order .\nOne could argue that Boudin \u2019 s brief tenure has done more to undermine San Francisco \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Internet itself .\nIt \u2019 s hard to fathom the thought process behind Soros \u2019 s devastating assault on America \u2019 s inner cities , where the vast majority of murder victims are poor , struggling minorities \u2013 the very people whom the billionaire investor and his progressive DAs claim to support .\nIn addition , because of the legal and financial sophistication with which Soros distributes his largess , it is infuriatingly hard to identify all the district attorneys and Defund the Police groups that have been nurtured with Soros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain his motivations .\nFor now , though , the pressing question is how to prevent Soros and others like him from manipulating the American justice system at the expense of law-abiding citizens .\nIt \u2019 s no easy task .\nAny national effort to limit how district attorney candidates are funded seems unlikely to succeed .\nUltimately , it will be up to voters .\nThey must be far more mindful of the massive power wielded by their local district attorneys and make choices that reflect an understanding of the district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law , not undermine it .\nSan Francisco , where voters have put a recall of Boudin on the ballot next year , may offer a ray of hope .\nIf the urban capital of woke liberalism can grow so repulsed by rampant crime that it seeks to remove a calamitous DA , perhaps voters elsewhere will also see the light .\nIt would not be a moment too soon .\n________________", "author": "Deneen Borelli", "url":

67 % \u2014 for those supporting parents \u2019 ability to opt their children out of curriculum they deem harmful or inappropriate .\nUnsurprisingly , that support is even higher among respondents who

.\nWhen it comes to virtual learning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country experienced at some point during 2020 pandemic lockdowns , the poll confirmed widespread concerns about its harmful impact on children

well ( think , say , of Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan ) .\nUnfortunately , that is not the leadership Americans are getting from this president .\nInstead , the Biden administration has tried to convince the public of things that are not just untrue but implausible .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ( and does not ) have a \u201c national strategy \u201d to defeat COVID ; our southern border is not

government spending never takes \u201c the pressure off of inflation.\n\u201d Of course , politicians often overstate things and sometimes outright lie .\nNothing new there .\nIt \u2019 s the in-your-face nature of the administration \u2019 s falsehoods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , take Biden \u2019 s efforts to promote his Build Back Better bill .\nThe administration often claims that the

everything would be free .\nSeriously , people get this .\nIn fairness , Biden was attempting to state that BBB wouldn \u2019 t add to the deficit because taxing the rich would pay for it .\nBut even that claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nJust about everybody outside of Washington , D.C. , knows that government programs are never actually \u201c paid for.\n\u201d We are already borrowing from our great-grandkids just to cover our current profligate spending .\nSo , the Democrats resorted to various accounting tricks and budgetary chicanery to make it appear as though taxing \u201c the rich \u201d would pay the BBB bills .\nFew were fooled .\nAnalyzing the bill using realistic assumptions , the Congressional Budget Office found that it would result in around $ 3 trillion in new deficit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Biden said that BBB \u2019 s massive government spending would take \u201c the pressure off of inflation.\n\u201d No less an authority than former Clinton and Obama economist Larry Summers warned in February that profligate government spending would \u201c set off inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation.\n\u201d The Democrats ignored him and passed a $ 1.9 trillion COVID relief boondoggle .\nIn hindsight , Summers was prescient .\nIn November , he recommended that the administration \u201c not compound errors \u201d it had already made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and overly easy monetary policy \u201d and reject Build Back Better .\nTo counter these concerns , Biden claimed that BBB \u2019 s massive government spending would bring down inflation because government would pick up the tab for certain household expenses , such as child care .\nOf course , this ignores the impact that the bill would have on the supply of \u2013 and demand for \u2013 child care .\nChild care providers are already in short supply .\nAccording to Sen. Richard Burr , ranking member of the Senate Health , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bill would shrink the supply further \u201c by killing off faith-based providers , small family child care homes , [ and ] kinship care , \u201d while increasing the demand for child care with massive government subsidies .\nNot surprisingly , a study by the Progressive Peoples Policy Project , a think tank as left-leaning as its name implies , found that the bill would actually increase the cost of child care for middle-class families by about $ 13,000 per child annually .\nThe supply-and-demand dynamic and its impact on inflation seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not to most Americans .\nAccording to the Penn Wharton Budget Model , the average American family will incur an additional $ 3,500 in expenses this year solely because of already-surging inflation .\nIt \u2019 s the kind of thing people notice .\nOf course , the administration made this implausible claim only because the bill needed West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin \u2019 s support to pass .\nManchin , however , made it clear that , with inflation already at a 40-year high , he wouldn \u2019 t support legislation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices .\nLike most Americans ( including Larry Summers ) , Manchin refused to be fooled .\nHe announced that he won \u2019 t support the bill \u2013 effectively killing it in its present shape .\nRarely deterred by reality , Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer then announced that the Senate would move forward with a vote on the bill nonetheless .\nProgressives have long lived in a bubble that cuts them off from
