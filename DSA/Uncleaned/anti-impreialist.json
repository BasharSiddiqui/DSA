Black , General Leroy Manor , and more key masterminds of the bloodbath carried out by the US in South East Asia .\nWith such well-respected war criminals as executives , Nugan Hand found it easy to swindle American civilians and servicemen worldwide .\nIn 2015 true crime writer Peter Butt managed to track Michael Hand down living under a new CIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working on his book \u201c Merchants of Menace.\n\u201d It was briefly front-page news but Hand remained untouchable for the authorities .\nNugan Hand was one of the more notorious examples of a CIA bank and all that entailed .\nAs Nugan Hand was on the rise its infamous predecessor Paul Helliwell \u2019 s Castle Bank was finally being shut down after decades of impunity serving the mafia and corrupt politicians like Richard Nixon .\nIt also served the CIA in a money laundering drug network reaching from South East Asia to Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role in covert wars in Vietnam and against Cuba .\nBCCI the next major CIA banking scandal ( except for the S & L debacle in the 1980s , also CIA and drug fueled ) was founded the year before Nugan Hand .\nEventually BCCI was used to fund the birth of Al Qaeda , launder money for drug syndicates and terrorists worldwide and support what became the Iran/Contra scandal .\nOf course the more well-known supposedly respectable banks , corporate banks , also do the CIA dirty work while laundering billions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invent the game .\nOne of the world \u2019 s largest banks , Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation ( HSBC ) , was founded by the British in the 19th century , using the massive profits from the opium trade .\nHong Kong , then a British crown colony , remained a major hub in the global heroin traffic .\n100 years later and Nugan Hand opened one of itsmore important branches there .\nIn taking control of the South East Asianheroin networks the CIA was merely following in the footsteps of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CIA bank .\nMoney laundering for drug syndicates , bribery of politicians and police , arms dealing , coups , covert warfare , massive embezzlement , fraud , tax evasion , murder , spying , terrorism comprised the range of utility to the CIA .\nWhat made it unusual was that it was not really a bank at all and until 1979 none of its executives had any banking experience .\nIt had helped topple Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam \u2019 s government in a soft coup in 1975 .\nFounded in 1973 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldwide with branches in Australia , the Philippines , the US , Thailand , Burma , Hong Kong , Panama , the Cayman Islands and more .\nIn Thailand its office was in Chiang Mai , then the heroin capital of the world , opened solely to help launder drug money and finance drug deals .\nNugan Hand shared its Chiang Mai office with the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) .\nIt supplied weapons for apartheid South Africa and its CIA backed allies in Angola ; armed apartheid Rhodesia ( now Zimbabwe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it waged a genocidal war in East Timor .\nIt helped Marcos in the Philippines , and the Shah of Iran move their money offshore .\nAt its height it appeared to be moving a billion dollars a year yet after its collapse it seemed to have been bankrupt all along .\nHonest depositors lost their life savings , while drug syndicates received partial re-payment , and Nugan Hand executives managed to steal a fortune .\nTo this day no one knows where all the money went .\nNugan Hand was named after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s parentswere both German Jewish refugees who met in Spain during the civil war after fleeing the Nazis .\nThey married in Palestine and then moved to Australia preferring to tell people they were Spanish and concealing their Jewish origins .\nThey became fruit growers in Griffith Australia .\nTheir sons Frank and Ken Nugan would later run their Nugan Fruit Group , which by the 1960 \u2019 s was entangled with the Calabrian Mafia who had turned Griffith into a major marijuana growing hotspot .\nThe Nugan Hand bank would owe its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fruit Group \u2019 s fraud , intimidation , and ties to the murderers of an anti-drug politician who had been targeting local marijuana growers .\nFrank Nugan was an egomaniac from an early age constantly wanting to be the center of attention , loving to push people over the edge by antagonizing them until they lost control .\nHe lied and manipulated people like a textbook sociopath but suffered severe mood swings .\nHe could be a charmer or an arrogant bully , brilliant or a complete fool .\nHe went to Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arcane degrees in the US at UC Berkley and studying in Canada although failing to get his PHD .\nHe returned to Australia and conned people into believing that he had helped rewrite the Canadian corporate tax code .\nHe got a job at a major law firm but soon quit because he saw little chance of advancement since he wasn \u2019 t from one of Australia \u2019 s more elite families .\nHe set up a mining company that went nowhere which soon was interlocked with Michael Hand \u2019 s land speculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two had met through the actual mastermind of the Nugan Hand scandal Bernie Houghton .\nAt first glance Houghton was merely an American bar owner in the heart of Sydney Australia \u2019 s vice district King \u2019 s Cross , a mecca for drugs , gambling , and prostitution .\nHoughton was in reality a CIA officer equally at home and well connected in the underworld , politics , intelligence and the military and seemed to be Michael Hand \u2019 s case officer .\nMichael Hand was born in the Bronx , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day after Pearl Harbor .\nHis mother died mysteriously when he was a child falling out of a 10-story window in an apparent suicide .\nThis left him extremely driven .\nHe studied for a year to be a park ranger , and thenmanaged a sports school before enlisting in the military in 1963 .\nHe was quickly selected for the Special Forces and trained at Fort Bragg befriending fellow recruit Douglas Sapper who would later be recruited into Nugan Hand providing muscle for couriers .\nIn February 1965 both were sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dong Xoia , a Montagnard ( Vietnamese hill tribes selected by the CIA as proxies and trained by special forces ) camp built along the Ho Chi Minh Trail ( the road troops and supplies traveled from North Vietnam into South Vietnam . )\nIt was typical ruthless cynicism to locate the camp of only 400 Montagnard troops and 19 American Special Forces advisers and Seabees engineers where it was certain to be attacked and overrun .\nAfter a couple months the inevitable occurred 1,500 NLF attacked and overran the camp .\nMichael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until his ammo ran out then gutting a man with his knife and ripping his head off with his bare hands .\nHe also managed to rescue a few injured Americans and became an instant war hero in the press .\nHe won the Distinguished Service Cross .\nSoon he was recruited into the CIA and sent to Laos to train the Hmong tribesmen who like the Montagnards had been selected by the CIA as proxies and trained by Special Forces operating under USAID cover .\nThe US had agreed to leave Laos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nPromises it broke , leading to the CIA \u2019 s secret war in Laos .\nThe Hmong had traditionally grown opium and the CIA had installed its man Vang Pao as their leader , helping him build a heroin factory to process the opium and flying the heroin out for him on their Air America flights even giving him his own airline .\nThe Laotian military and Laotian politicians were equally involved in the heroin trade .\nA series of coups in Laos had just as much to do with transferring control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the CIA goal to push the country into civil war by overthrowing neutralist governments and ultimately provoking the left Pathet Lao forces to fight back .\nMichael Hand was soon at home in the world of the deep politics of the global drug trade advising the Hmong and also working closely with the Air America pilots .\nHe met Theodore Shackley and Thomas Clines who both served tours as Chief of Station in Laos .\nClines taking over for Shackley when Shackley became Chief of Station in Vietnam .\nHand and Houghton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s full of heroin in various Southeast Asian locales long after they had supposedly retired .\nIt was while in Southeast Asia that Hand was recruited into an Australian real estate scheme eventually known as Ocean Shores , one of whose backers was the singer Pat Boone .\nFor my younger readers in the early days of Rock & Roll white radio stations refused to play black groups so Pat Boone would re-record their songs in his soulless manner epitomizing uncoolness for a generation .\nBoone was also a frequent guest on Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discover him involved in Michael Hand \u2019 s shady land deals that were a cover for heroin smuggling .\nMichael Hand returned to America then mysteriously decided to move to Australia telling them he planned to become a simple farmer .\nMost likely it was merely his latest assignment for the CIA and he was being assigned to assist Bernie Houghton .\nA former military man and tough talking Texan Houghton was a CIA man operating under civilian cover although this has never been officially confirmed .\nAfter serving in the military he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling war surplus and running bars and sex traffic for American troops .\nHe was sent in advance to Australia to set up 3 bars and restaurants in Sydney Australia .\nHe was already in on the secret decision to use Australia as a place to send troops on R & R ( Rest & Relaxation . )\nUpon arriving in Australia he was instantly hired by one of the most wealthy and powerful men in Australia Sir Paul Strasser , a real estate tycoon .\nSir Paul Strasser was part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another of this same circle Sir Peter Abeles , the wealthy shipping tycoon , would later act as one of Michael Hand \u2019 s patrons .\nApparently it was a matter of national security that the troops would party with proper supervision that the CIA or military would control the prostitutes because their was no telling what horrific or embarrassing secrets they might reveal whether about the industrial scale mass murder , the massive Phoenix program , the secret wars in Laos , Cambodia and Thailand or the massive drug trade that interconnected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even arrived in Australia Houghton would arrive introduced by the commanding officers and the troops would be told to head for Houghton \u2019 s Bourbon and Beefsteak .\nOnce they were at the bar they could obtain anything from illegal drugs to prostitutes or sent to one of Houghton \u2019 s friend \u2019 s illegal casinos .\nThere was a ping ball sex show upstairs .\nThe food on the other hand was terrible .\nHoughton was gay and ran a network of young spies former lovers and ex-roommates .\nHe had ties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and around the world .\nHis bar was also a favorite hang out of Australian gangsters , crooked cops and American mafia-linked figures forced to flee the US .\nMob lawyer Harry Wainwright was one of Houghton \u2019 s cronies .\nWainwright had been granted Australian citizenship despite the fact that the FBI was about to arrest him .\nHis request was approved by the same immigration official who admitted Michael Hand .\nHoughton was a middleman , a fixer embodying the interconnections between , business , crime and intelligence .\nHe was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businessman Frank Nugan and drug world spy Michael Hand .\nHoughton had also been granted a security clearance by the ASIO , the Australian version of MI5 or the FBI and was allowed to make secret trips without a visa to various Southeast Asianlocales .\nOnce in Australia , Michael Hand began working on his land scheme selling worthless plots of land to his military buddies , Air America pilots and Australian customs officials .\nWhen Nugan Hand was at its height the legend was it was funded from the profits from Hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nugan \u2019 s Mining scheme .\nYet Hand \u2019 s Ocean Shores was mostly worthless , as the land was never developed .\nThe plots were sold for around ten thousand a piece then later bought back at a fraction of the cost and resold in Panama .\nOvertly it was small time but at least one of the buyers , Michael Hand \u2019 s friend Kermit \u201c Bud \u201d King , built an airstrip that his Thai housekeeper informed police was used to smuggle heroin .\nIronically it was King who brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin with .\nAfter coming to the attention of the crooked drug cops King quickly wound up dead .\nBy then Nugan Hand had been founded and four days later Michael Hand \u201c resigned \u201d from Nugan Hand claiming he was going to become a turkey farmer .\nIn reality it was a cover for a year long mission to sell arms to South Africa and Rhodesia for the CIA \u2019 s covert wars in Angola , Namibia , Mozambique , and its propping up of apartheid in violation of US arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nKing and Hand had been part of a drug ring and King was probably murdered when word leaked that the FBN was onto him .\nHand was out of the country when King died however just as he was when Nugan later died .\nIt was via Ocean Shores , which repeatedly changed its name like most of the Nugan Hand Shell Companies , that Nugan and Hand became intertwined .\nNugan \u2019 s secretary was on the board of directors .\nSoon Ocean shores loaned Frank Nugan money in exchange for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some of the basic ingredients in white-collar crime , the creation of multiple shell companies , the transfer of worthless stock , the issuing of loans that are canceled and never repaid .\nWorthless assets are traded from shell company to shell company creating the illusion of valuable assets , which are used as collateral for loans that are never repaid .\nA complex web of transactions boils down to a sort of shell game or three card monty .\nThe whole thing is so complicated and boring that it is nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the public or for a prosecutor to explain to a jury .\nSo the game goes on .\nBank crash follows bank crash , real estate bubble follows real estate bubble and people think it is all as natural as the change in seasons .\nNugan Hand was founded in July 1973 .\nThe lawyer and the Green Beret may have been selected in part to form the bank because their names gave the bank an Asian sound .\nNeither had any banking experience but Frank Nugan was a brilliant financial conman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money markets allowed the bank to offer an extra 2 % of interest to depositors .\nNugan was also able to convince the gullible that his tax evasion schemes were all perfectly legal .\nIn reality the bank operated on two levels and depositors funds were used as a slush fund to enable the bank to carry out its real work of illegally moving money overseas for drug syndicates and tax evaders .\nFrank Nugan had created a simple strategy he called \u201c The Contra \u201d .\nA drug dealer would make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nugan would call ahead to one of the Asian branches and tell them to give the client an equal amount of money when he arrived in a couple days , minus the commission of up to 22 % .\nThe second transaction was off the record so it would appear no money had been moved .\nThe dealer would use the cash to buy drugs and then smuggle them back to Australia perhaps for shipment on to the US or elsewhere .\nThe same system was later used to fund assassinations or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more complex schemes involving fake loans and shell companies .\nIn the 1970s most countries including Australia had strict foreign exchange rules forbidding export of capital overseas .\nNugan came up with a number of schemes to both move money overseas and to create tax shelters to cheat on taxes .\nThe CIA was very interested in controlling the flow of this offshore wealth since it would provide them with leverage over Nugan Hand clients which eventually included Thai generals , Laotian princes , dictators like the Shah of Iran and Ferdinand Marcos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Princes .\nOn 11 November 1975 , a soft coup toppled Prime Minister Gough Whitlam .\nFor decades the CIA had worked with the ASIO that it had helped set up to manipulate the Australian political scene .\nThey funded the Liberal-Country Coalition .\nThe CIA also manipulated the unions .\nWhitlam had dared to complain about CIA ties to his political opponents .\nHe had already angered the US by opposing the war in Vietnam and withdrawing Australian troops .\nIn March1973 Whitlam had taken the extraordinary step of having the Attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ASIO headquarters .\nThe CIA was outraged that its secrets had been exposed in the process .\nEven more important to the CIA and the US national security state was the huge listening post it had built at Pine Gap .\nIt was used to monitor electronic communications across the entire region , receive spysatellite signals , and relay orders to the US atomic submarine fleet .\nIt had been built under the false cover story that it was part of the space program .\nWhitlam worried that it could make Australia a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discover his own intelligence agencies had lied to him and told him its head Michael Stallings was with the Department of Defense and not the CIA .\nWorse Stallings was renting a house from the right wing head of the Country Party Doug Anthony .\nWhitlam requested a list of all CIA agents operating in Australia but his own intelligence agencies were more interested in maintaining friendly relations with the CIA than in obeying the head of Government .\nEarly in 1975 Whitlam further alienated both Australian and US intelligence when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying about Australia \u2019 s role in the genocidal war on East Timor , which would eventually claim hundreds of thousands of lives .\nIn December 1975 the Pine Gap treaty was up for renegotiation .\nWhitlam had to be removed before he could interfere further in the CIA \u2019 s schemes .\nThe exact role of the Nugan Hand bank in the coup is unclear but Houghton was almost certainly involved .\nThe ASIO and the CIA chief of station , John Walker , had granted him a security clearance .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Israel shortly before the coup , and the new CIA chief of station , Milton Corley Wonus spent long hours at his bar , the Bourbon and Beefsteak .\nHoughton also had close ties to people at the Union Bank of Switzerland ( UBS ) that helped frame members of the Whitlam government .\nThe Whitlam Government was destabilized in a way eerily similar to the recent coup in Brazil .\nThe CIA and ASIO leaked information to the press including a forged telex that implicated the Labour government in the \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treasury head and then the energy minister .\nWhitlam began to slide in the opinion polls and the opposition decided to force an early election by refusing to pass the budget .\nHowever Whitlam was able to mobilize opinion against this attempt to paralyze the government and it no longer appeared certain he would lose in an early election .\nDrastic measures were needed .\nOn 8 November 1975 , Theodore Shackley , by then CIA assistant deputy director for operations sent an ultimatum to ASIO on Whitlam claiming that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their activities in public .\nIn CIA parlance Whitlam was exposing sources and methods and was a dangerous threat to national security and if he weren \u2019 t dealt with the CIA would cut ties to Australian intelligence .\nShackley was backed in this ultimatum by Henry Kissinger himself .\nOnly three days later on 11 November 1975 , John Kerr the Australian Governor General ( the representative of the British crown ) , untilthen a largely ceremonial post , removed Whitlam from office due to an obscure power that had never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the OSS , the predecessor to the CIA , and had spent decades working for various CIA fronts like the Australian Association for Cultural Freedom .\nHis work had also been subsidized by the CIA .\nKerr appointed Liberal Party leader Malcolm Fraser as the new temporary Prime minister .\nIronically Whitlam had appointed Kerr the year before the soft coup as a concession to his right wing critics .\nWhen Nugan Hand collapsed Shackley \u2019 s right hand man Thomas Clines would show up to help Bernie Houghton escape to Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the year of the soft coup against Whitlam , was the same year Michael Hand had announced his sudden \u201c retirement \u201d from the bank fourdays after the death of his friend , Air America pilot Bud King .\nHe claimed he was going to become a turkey farmer .\nInstead he was heading to Africa along with hundreds of CIA men and mercenaries hired through CIA contractors .\nHand had pretended to resign to distance himself from Nugan Hand \u2019 s American branch in Hawaii because he was going into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperately hung onto its African colonies of Angola , Guinea Bissau , and Mozambique battling African revolutionaries intent on liberating their countries .\nHowever Portugal \u2019 s government had recently been overthrown by a left wing coup and the new government decided to end the costly African wars and grant the new countries independence .\nThe American empire and the CIA which had backed NATO member Portugal \u2019 s wars to keep African \u2019 s subjugated now faced the emergence of left leaning African governments in Angola and Mozambique .\nThe US and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Africa and Mobutu in Zaire to try to install its proxies in Angola and Mozambique or at least to wage bloody dirty wars to destabilize the new governments .\nIn Angola Cuba decided to send troops to counter a US backed South African invasion .\nEventually not only would Cuba successfully defend Angola \u2019 s independence but its victory would lead to the liberation of South Africa and Namibia .\nHand spent the year traveling from Angola to apartheid Rhodesia and South Africa setting up arms deals .\nThe exact details are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to carry out a major arms deal with the notorious Ed Wilson who ran profitable CIA arms dealing and consulting fronts .\nWilson had known Bernie Houghton since before he supposedly resigned from the CIA in 1971 .\nWilson would later hire Houghton and Nugan Hand to help him with his Libyan arms deals and construction schemes and after Nugan Hand \u2019 s collapse Houghton would go to work for Wilson \u2019 s EATSCO in which his partners were Thomas Clines , Richard Secord , and Theodore Shackley .\nHoughton \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Ed Wilson \u2019 s Geneva Switzerland office .\nEven after Hand \u2019 s return from Africa to Australia in 1976 Nugan Hand would continue to supply arms illegally to South Africa and many other places including Indonesia , Burma , and Thailand .\nOn his way back to Australia in 1976 Michael Hand opened a Nugan hand branch in Panama , another money laundering and drug smuggling hub .\nThen he arrived in Australia and was immediately reinstated at Nugan Hand .\nIn 1977 Hand would travel to Hong Kong to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neil Evans to open the Chiang Mai branch in Thailand to help drug dealing Thai Generals and warlords move their money overseas .\nWithin two years Nugan Hand would have more than a dozen branches around the world , Chile , Argentina , the Philippines , Singapore , West Germany , London , and the Cayman Islands .\nIt was during this global expansion that Nugan Hand recruited a half dozen American generals and admirals through Bernie Houghton .\nHand was now bragging privately about the banks CIA backing .\nAdmiral Earl \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was recruited as the bank \u2019 s president .\nAdmiral Yates was the former Commander of the USS John F. Kennedy aircraft carrier and chief of staff for plans and policy for Pacific Command .\nPacific Command had responsibility for all of Asia , including of course the wars in Vietnam , Laos , and Cambodia .\nGeneral Edwin Black had been in the OSS serving under Allen Dulles and above Richard Helms , both of whom went on to become infamous CIA directors .\nAfter serving Eisenhower \u2019 s Psychological Strategy Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served on the military staff of the National Security Council .\nHe was in charge of US Forces in Vietnam when it was still a covert war .\nHe then headed US Forces in Thailand before becoming an assistant division commander in Vietnam and Assistant Army Chief of Staff for Pacific Command .\nHe also headed the Freedom Foundation .\nGeneral Leroy Manor was a fighter pilot in World War 2 , Korea , and Vietnam .\nHe commanded air bases at Clark Field and Subic Bay in the Philippines .\nHe had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had negotiated a USD 500 million military aid package for the Philippines and spent seven months with President Marcos renegotiating the leases for US bases in the Philippines .\nHe was an expert on counter-Insurgency .\nHe was recruited to run the Nugan Hand branch in the Philippines , sharing his office with the Marcos \u2019 brother in law Ludwig Rocka .\nGeneral Earle Cocke was a specialist in moving \u201c black money \u201d for various government agencies .\nHe was very close to President Carter .\nDuring World War Two he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firing squad .\nHe went on to work at various shadowy jobs at the Department of Defense , was a former executive at Delta Airlines and former National Commander of the American Legion .\nNugan Hand \u2019 s Washington DC branch was run by Cocke out of the offices of his Cocke and Philips International Consulting Firm .\nNugan Hand also recruited a number of CIA men .\nFormer CIA director William Colby and his law firm Reid & Priest were hired as lawyers representing Nugan .\nColby had helped set up Gladio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief of station in Vietnam during the formation of the Phoenix assassination program .\nWalter McDonald had headed the CIA \u2019 s economic division for 25 years and was no mere analyst .\nWhen Admiral Yates introduced him he noted that while many were unaware of the role of the CIA \u2019 s economic division it was \u201c acknowledged in this world of grass politics , drug events and battles and it starts generally in the area Walt is heading.\n\u201d McDonald was given the unenviable task of babysitting the drunk and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also Guy Pauker a CIA man under Rand cover he had arrived in Indonesia in 1958 during the CIA \u2019 s failed plot to overthrow Sukarno using a military uprising .\nHe joked that by 1965 the friends he had made back in 1958 were now running the country .\nThe CIA had successfully overthrown Sukarno and was helping Pauker \u2019 s \u201c Friends \u201d carry out one of the bloodiest massacres of the cold war with one million suspected communists and ethnic Chinese slaughtered by death squads .\nPauker was still a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had unleashed another blood bath after invading East Timor in 1975 .\nPauker was an adviser to both Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski .\nNugan Hand Taiwan was run by former Civil Air Transport executive CIA Dale Holmgren .\nAir America , the CIA \u2019 s drug smuggling airline , had grown out of the CIA/Taiwan airline CAT Civil Air Transport that had been smuggling heroin since the early days of the cold war .\nMichael Hand and Admiral Yates recruited another infamous CIA figure Mitch Werbell III the expert on silencers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun .\nWerBell ran a mercenary training camp in Georgia and was recruited by Hand as a consultant on his project to resettle the Hmong and Montagnards in the Caribbean where they could be used as a proxy army to menace Cuba .\nThe scheme fell through but they were eventually used as proxies in Reagan \u2019 s Central American wars .\nThis array of admirals , generals , and CIA officers were executives at a bank that was deeply involved with the Mr Asia syndicate and its series of murders .\nFour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incidents and they all talked to police .\nThree of the four ended up dead and the fourth was beaten unconscious with baseball bats .\nThey had talked and the cops were on Mr Asia \u2019 s payroll via Nugan Hand \u2019 s Australian law firm run by John Aston and Brian Alexander .\nThe firm represented a number of drug dealers including the Mr Asia syndicate .\nAlexander ran a network of corrupt cops that extended through every level of Australian drug law enforcement .\nThey immediately informed Alexander any time someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their bribes were paid in some cases through opening accounts for them in Nugan Hand .\nWhen Nugan Hand first came under suspicion for its role in the drug trade the FBN ( Federal Bureau of Narcotics ) investigators discovered that Frank Nugan knew every detail about their investigation within hours of it occurring thanks to Alexander .\nIn fact Frank Nugan boldly arrived at FBN headquarters on 14 February 1978 protesting his complete innocence and boasting of his political connections .\nWithin weeks higher ups in the FBN had killed the investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law firm was used as a drop point by Nugan Hand clients Frank Nugan had helped launder $ 300,000 from a bank robbery for Mr Asia to finance these murders and Hand had personally managed the Asian end of the operation .\nFinally the number 2 man in Mr Asia , Terry Clark , planned the murder of Mr Asia syndicate \u2019 s head Christopher Martin Johnson who was getting too much press attention .\nHis dismembered corpse was buried in four separate countries .\nAgain the money trail led through Nugan Hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nugan Hand \u2019 s collapse lawyer Brian Alexander \u201c disappeared \u201d after having his feet tied to an antique stove before being tossed overboard from a police boat .\nAnother murderous disappearance would cause trouble for the Nugan Fruit Group .\nDonald Mackay was the Griffith Branch president of the Liberal Party who had launched an anti-drug crusade against the Calabrian marijuana growers .\nOn 15 July 1977 , he disappeared .\nPolice found bloodstains in his van and shell casings at the scene so he was presumed murdered .\nRecords showed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gangster \u2019 s who were the main suspects in the killing Antonio Sergi and Robert Trimbole .\nTrimbole was also part of the Mr Asia syndicate .\nAfter Mackay \u2019 s death a Royal Commission was appointed to investigate his murder and the Griffith drug scene .\nBack in 1973 Ken Nugan had sold a 40 % share in the Nugan Fruit Group to an insurance company and they were demanding an audit to discover why payment had been sent to gangsters and because they realized Ken Nugan was embezzling money .\nKen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the fall of 1977 they carried out a sort of \u201c corporate coup.\n\u201d First they hired corrupt cops infamous as strong-arm men and hired killers to terrorize the auditors .\nWhen that didn \u2019 t work the cops hired a bunch
